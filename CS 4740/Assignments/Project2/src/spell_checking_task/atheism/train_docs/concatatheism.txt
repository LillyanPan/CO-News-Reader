The victor emerges and has earned the privilege of inseminating the choir boys . " P  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated . It's only one aspect of morality . Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so . Individual morality is a different thing , it often includes societal mores ( or society is in trouble ) , but is stronger . For example , some people are vegetarian , though eating meat may be perfectly legal . # # > #Merely a question for the basis of morality # > # # > #Moral / Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_ . # > # # > # 1 ) Who is society # # > Depends on the society . # #Doesn't help .

What right do we have to interfere ? IMO , it isn't often that interference ( i . e . jail , and force of various kinds and degrees ) is both necessary and effective . Where you derive the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox : " force is necessary for freedom " . One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom . # # The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem # > that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem # > to agree that some level of interference is necessary . # #They see the need for a " justice " system .

What I mean is that , while thus-and-such may be legal , thus-and-such may also be seen as immoral . The law lets you do it , but you don't let yourself do it .

Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have to acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos and biases . Some scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof for the theory .

Not really . I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ( $ 7,500 , 000 I believe ) , especially considering the outcome . My point was that mass suicides in the U .

Thus while I believe that no gods exist , this does ^ ^ ^ > not imply * faith * on my part that it is so . ^ ^ ^ Let me first say that " to believe that no gods exist " is in fact different than " not believing in a god or gods " . I will argue that your latter statement , " I believe that no gods exist " does rest upon faith - that is , if you are making a POSITIVE statement that " no gods exist " ( strong atheism ) rather than merely saying I don't know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then ( weak atheism ) . Once again , to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist . I still maintain the position , even after reading the FAQs , that strong atheism requires faith . But first let me say the following . We might have a language problem here - in regards to " faith " and " existence " . I , as a Christian , maintain that God does not exist . To exist means to have being in space and time . God does not HAVE being - God IS Being . Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist , He is eternal . With this said , I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called " existence " of God - and that is not what I'm doing here . I believe that God is the source and ground of being . When you say that " god does not exist " , I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it . However , in what follows I will use the phrase " the existence of God " in it's ' usual sense ' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it . I would like a clarification upon what you mean by " the existence of God " . We also might differ upon what it means to have faith . Here is what Webster says : faith 1a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b ( 1 ): fidelity to one's promises ( 2 ): sincerity of intentions 2a ( 1 ): belief and trust in and loyalty to God ( 2 ): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b ( 1 ): firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^ ^ ^ ( 2 ): complete trust 3 : something that is believed esp . with strong conviction ; esp : a system ^ ^ ^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist . When you say that you believe God does not exist , and that this is an opinion " based upon observation " , I will have to ask " what observtions are you refering to ? " There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief . All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to ( by predisposed I mean , for example , people whoes partents " believe in God " also tend to ) . To actually draw a conclusion about the " existence " or " non-existence " of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say " I believe that God does / does not exist " . Personally , I think that both statements are misguided . Arguing over the " existence " of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him ( and yes , I use " Him " because a personal God is the only viable concept ( IMO ) - if a person wants to use " She " go ahead . Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise .

An interesting question would be if atoms > are objects ( classical ) or phenomenon ( neo-quantum ) or what ? I've been following this train of talk , and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense " not real " leaves me uneasy . It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects , and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real . The tree outside my window is in this category ... is observe the light which bounces off of it , not the tree itself . The observation is indirect , but no more so than observations I have made of atoms . Also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms . I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time . Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either . One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field . What I read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring . Anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it worked . After doing so , I'm willing to try to defend the following assertion if anyone cares : Atoms are as real as trees , and are real in the ussual every-day sense of the word " real " .From : b711zbr@utarlg.uta.edu ( JUNYAN WANG ) Subject : Bible contradictions I would like a list of Bible contadictions from those of you who dispite being free from Christianity are well versed in the Bible .From : nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu ( David Nye ) Subject : Re : Amusing atheists and agnostics [ reply to timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu ( Bake Timmons ] > ... the same kind of ignorance is demonstrated in just about every post > in this newsgroup .

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is a complete lie and deception , as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving . Liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , almost always at the cost to another . Whos liberty is more inalienable ? Similarly for right of life . When one person must die if he is to save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty , especially for serial killers . Whos life and liberty is more valuable , the serial killer , or the victim ? According to that beautiful line , those two rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able to remove them . This _includes_ government . Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and / or liberty , but is not his own life / liberty inviolate also ?

Assuming you are presenting it accurately , I don't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion . The material in John ( I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here , but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt . / Luke " Q " material ) IS different ; hence , one could have almost any relationship between the two , right up to John getting it straight from Jesus ' mouth . > We are talking date of texts here , not the age of the authors .

Good statement ! Should we apply empirical measurements to define exact social morals ? Should morals be based on social rules ? On ancient religious doctrines ? It seems there will * NEVER * be a common and single denominator for defining morals , and as such defining absolute and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have this incredible talent of creative thinking .

Once a criminal has committed a murder , his desires are irrelevant . And , you still have not answered my question .

The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief . I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu . First of all , I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail ; it's possible to give succinct answers to most everything , but there's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours , I'm sure . As much detail as you want to give me ( I mean it ) is great , but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible , so even minimal responses are far better than nothing - - it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration . Secondly , I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious ; I know that phrases like " What would convince you of the existence of God " imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens . In fact , I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself , so my use of " God " is a question of locution rather than ideology - - it's easier than just repeating " a deity or higher power " every time . Also , I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like " belief system " although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs , but are skeptical towards everything . I understand ; but you know what I mean . Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across . Lastly , thanks ! Please fill out as much as you can , in as much detail as you can , and send them to me . My research and I thank you . - - - Where would you place your beliefs , on the spectrum Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism ? Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs . In what , if any , religious tradition were you raised ? Did you ever believe in the existence of a God ? ( Several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is " yes ; " if you've always been an atheist , or at least never a theist , you may have to modify the question / answer somewhat . ) How serious was your / your family's involvement ? How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe ? How and when did your " final break " with your beliefs , if any , occur ? I realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an " event " per se ; whatever the case , just describe it in whatever detail you wish . What contact with other atheists have you had ; before and after ( and during ) your " conversion " to atheism ? ( Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts - - how have net discussions affected your beliefs ? ) To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs ? Did you come by your beliefs through discussion , through independent means , or by some combination of the two or other means ? Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means ( proofs of the non-existence of God , etc ) , or was it perhaps , at least in part , through other means ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc ) ? To what extent do you feel you " understand " the universe through your beliefs ? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence ( anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs ) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where are they lacking as an explanatory method ? What would it take for you to question , or change , your beliefs ? What would convince you of the existence of God , what would convince you of the plausibility of God's existence , and so forth ? How dynamic are your beliefs - - are they constantly changing ; have they stayed more or less the same for some time ? Are you involved in a career or education in science ? To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs ? ( Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new " secular religion , " and that " scientists are , in a very real sense , the new priesthood . " Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi - religious base , or even a religious element ? ) - - - This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals , but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me . Would you be willing to have me , on the basis of this survey , write you to find out more about you and your beliefs ? If not , fine ; your filling out the survey alone is great . - - - Thanks again . Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I'm doing with this data , or if you have anything to say in addition to what I've asked about above . Mark Abbott mtabbott@unix.amherst.edFrom : acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu Subject : Idle questions for fellow atheists I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population . It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways , I know , but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit , so I figure I might as well post something new myself . Also , how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from the other , qualitatively . But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere , and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core , than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ; ie , how it expresses its own selfishness .

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic . But to do so is absolutely useless now . If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture , you could have , but you chose to wait . Now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation . " But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . " - Matthew 24:13 II . REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ's second coming . Also know as " the time of Jacob's ( Israel's ) trouble " ( Jere 30:7 ) and " Daniel's Seventieth Week " ( Dan 9 ) , this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror . III . GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community ( the revived Roman Empire ) , Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason . The Bible , however , will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation . IV . READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated , even if you are careful , it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them . It is especially important to read Daniel , Luke 21 , Matthew 24 , Revelation , and Amos , for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you . V . PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray and pray . Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ . VI . DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community , he will institute a world economic system , designed so that you cannot buy , sell , or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name . Money will be useless . " And he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads , and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . Here is wisdom . Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man : His number is 666 " - Revelation 13:16- 18 . The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity . Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past , such as the Holocaust . [ or maybe the crusades ? - M ] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's rule ; it will be much worse than anything in history ( Matt 24:21 ) " ... I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held . And a white robe was given to each of them : and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer , until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren , who would be killed as they were , was completed . " Revelation 6:9 , 11 . His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn / " ... And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands . " - Revelation 20:4 . He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ . Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you , even your children , torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark . If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image , however , you will be consigned to the second death , which is the Lake of Fire . [ Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash ... - M ] You cannot be redeemed . It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [ sic ] to endure eternal torment in the Ring ^ H ^ H ^ H ^ H Lake of Fire . " ... If anyone worships the Beast and his image , and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand , he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation . An [ sic ] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb . " - Revelation 14:9- 10 [ and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders ; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium - - M ] VII . SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government until the end of the Tribulation , all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening , since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake . The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area , for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas . Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation . [ " As you can see on the weather map , heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak . Expect delays on I - 95 outbound , and perhaps school closings " - - M ] Store water and food , because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark . Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood . [ Get a good water filter . - - M ] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons , as well as flashlights , batteries , generators , and First Aid supplies . In short , learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did . VIII . TRUST NO ONE There will be secret agents everywhere , spying for the Antichrist's government . Be on the lookout . [ Perot supporters take note - - M ] IX . WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to , for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it . We can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man . Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation , he will dominate the airwaves . He will be physically appealing , highly intelligent , with Christ-like charisma and personality . An international politician , military tactician and economic expert , his word will be peace ; he will make a treaty with the Jews , which he will break after three and a half years . He will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed . Even the very elect will be deceived . If you do not pray and read the Bible , you too will be deceived . [ Dominate the airwaves ? Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh ... - M ] The antichrist will have a companion , the False Prohphet [ sic ] , who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak . All who refuse to worhsip [ sic ] the image will be killed . The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane , with demonized spirits everywhere . X . DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE ! The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ . The Antichrist will be defeated . Be steadfast and endure , and you will be rewarded greatly in Heaven . Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now . The salvation of your sould depends upon it . Determine that , come what may , you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist . You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved , but this time you will have to be " faithful unto death .

I haven't read Lewis's article , so I can't comment directly upon it , and have only spoken about his writings _in general _ so far , that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam . His anti-Islamic polemics , as I understand it , are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths . Again , read " Orientalism " by Edward Said . I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust , in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book ( it is a well-known book ) and check the evidence out for _yourself_ . > The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES , > when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex . > I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines , I wrote an > incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not > want his concubine to get pregnant etc . , which is contrary > to the notion that " sex is for procreation only " .

I understand your point of view , Selim - - I think , rather , it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ . Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before . Regarding women , I have made posting after posting on this subject , showing that Islam is not anti-woman , etc . However , have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them ? I just reposted a very good one , under the title " Islam and Women " , reposted from soc.religion.islam . If this has already disappeared from your site , then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article . IMHO , your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient . Regarding slaves , _my_ posting on slavery - - the second one I made , which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year - - is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view . Our approaches are different - - you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths . Now , just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action , does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam , even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah ? No ! Of course not . Let me give you a concrete example , which might help clarify this for you . The Qur'an prohibits drinking . Now , if a person says " I am a Muslim " and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer , does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer ? Of course not , and only an idiot would think so . Do you see my point ? > It is very natural to think that > the author / authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic > structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm > shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of > the feudal era and the rise of commerce , second with the industrial > revolution .

In fact , the rise of Islam can easily be modeled > after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home , > but increase your wealth by conquering places . You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms . Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth - - this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings . To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking - - Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist . ( This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market - - for it does in general - - but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it . ) > When this stopped , > you ( and I ) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour . > No capital , no industry , very poor social services - the education > level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world , the health > statistics are miserable etc .. One can postulate numerous reasons for this . Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist , etc . etc . Selim , I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think ( as you obviously do ) that Islam = > lack of education and power . For a large part of history , the Islamic world was very powerful . For a significant section of history , the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences . So to say that Islam is , for example , anti-education is completely absurd . You try to blame this situation on Islam - - history shows that your conclusion is false and that , instead , there must be other reasons for this situation . > You blame Muslims for not following the Quran , but I blame Muslims > for following the Quran . Well , Selim , your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam . I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not . > Your idea is baseless from historical > facts , it is a poor utopia , The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage - - yet somehow , in your theory , it is by " following the Qur'an " that Muslims are backwards in education . Selim , it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical , for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory . > while my ideas are derived from social > and economic history . You have certainly not shown this ; you have merely stated it . So far , it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history . That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this . > My solution to all Muslims is simple : > CUT THE CRAP , I think , Selim , you should consider taking your own advice . > GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too . > AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE > THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE . Selim , you have such conviction of your viewpoint , yet you demonstrate ignorance , not only of Islam but also of Islamic history ( particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think ) . Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history ! Selim , if I remember right , you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam . I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues , and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have .

Thanks for a well put testimonial . Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice . The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right , but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up .

However , who is at blame is another question .

So when you do > either , you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or > later result in the killing of an innocent person . Yes , but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity .

Okay , so this is what you call murder . But , the question is whether or not all such " murders " are wrong .

Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution . And , every member of society shares this blame .

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not .

Yes , while we could objectively determine the difference ( if we knew all possible information ) , we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system . I think that our system is almost as good as possible , but it still isn't objectively perfect . You see , it doesn't matter if we * know * it is fair or not .

A climatologist ( Ithink that was his profession ) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec . 3 . Some schools in Missouri that were on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day . Many people evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are . I wouldn't be suprised if there were more journalists in the area than residents . Of course , teh earthquake never occured . HOw do I know about his ? I used to live in Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the fault line . No we still had school ...

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I've articulated it above _ ( which may not be the true view of Khomeini ) is from the basic principles of Islam . So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them .

I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur'an .

Those that > claim that there is no evidence for the existence of God or that His will is > unknown , must deliberately ignore the Bible ; the ignorance itself is > no excuse . 1 ) No , they don't have to ignore the Bible . The Bible is far from universally accepted . The Bible is NOT a proof of god ; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god . ( Or does it prove even that ? They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories . As in the case of Dionetics . ) Assuming the writers believed it , the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it . And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct . 2 ) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible . 3 ) Again , read the FAQ . > freedom . You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to > ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known > in both cases . That an atheist can't accept the evidence means only Bzzt ... wrong answer ! Gravity is directly THERE . It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it . God , on the other hand , doesn't generally show up in the supermarket , except on the tabloids . God doesn't exert a rationally undeniable influence .

Human reason > always comes back to the question of God , in every generation and in No , human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of " God " ; it has usually come back to the existance of " god " . In other words , it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god , it comes back to whether there is any god . And , in much of oriental philosophic history , it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there . From a world-wide view , human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and / or what force ( s ) are currently in control .

McElwaine , Physicist Ninety to a hundred years ago , everybody " knew " that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly . It would violate the " laws " of physics . All of the " experts " and " authorities " said so . For example , Simon Newcomb declared in 1901 : " The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances , known forms of machinery and known forms of force , can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air , seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be . " Fortunately , a few SMART people such as the Wright Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final word . Now we take airplanes for granted , ( except when they crash ) . Today , orthodox physicists and other " scientists " are saying similar things against several kinds of ' Free Energy ' Technologies , using negative terms such as " pseudo-science " and " perpetual motion " , and citing so-called " laws " which assert that " energy cannot be created or destroyed " ( " 1st law of thermodynamics " ) and " there is always a decrease in useful energy " ( " 2nd law of thermodynamics " ) . The physicists do not know how to do certain things , so they ARROGANTLY declare that those things cannot be done . Such PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern " science " and help to cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox modern theories . Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe , with - OUT burning any kind of fuel , making them the PERFECT SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated pollution , degradation , and depletion of the environment . Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy , but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by various forms of induction . UNLIKE solar or wind devices , they need little or no energy storage capacity , because they can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed . Solar energy has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds , trees , buildings , or the earth itself , or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes . Likewise , wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and often non-existent . Neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes . Properly designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations . For example , at least three U . S . patents ( # 3,811 , 058 , # 3,879 , 622 , and # 4,151 , 431 ) have so far been awarded for motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS , seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic field . The first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running . The third one , as described in detail in " Science & Mechanics " magazine , Spring 1980 , ( " Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor " , by Jorma Hyypia , pages 45-48 , 114-117 , and front cover ) , requires critical sizes , shapes , orientations , and spacings of magnets , but NO feedback . Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one's home , YEAR ROUND , FOR FREE . [ Complete descriptive copies of U . S . patents are $ 3.00 each from the U . S . Patent Office , 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy . , Arlington , VA 22202 ; correct 7 - digit patent number required . Or try getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your local public or university library's inter-library loan dept .. ] A second type of free-energy device , such as the ' Gray Motor ' ( U . S . Patent # 3,890 , 548 ) , the ' Tesla Coil ' , and the motor of inventor Joseph Newman [ see SCIENCE , 2-10- 84 , pages 571-2 . ] , taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from ' EARTH RESONANCE ' ( about 12 cycles per second plus harmonics ) . They typically have a ' SPARK GAP ' in the circuit which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped . It is important that the total ' inductance ' and ' capacitance ' of the Device combine to ' RESONATE ' at the same frequency as ' EARTH RESONANCE ' in order to maximize the power output . This output can also be increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the ' NEUTRAL CENTER ' of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet . In the case of a Tesla Coil , slipping a ' TOROID CHOKE COIL ' around the secondary coil will enhance output power . [ " Earth Energy : Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems " , by John Bigelow , 1976 , Health Research , P . O . Box 70 , Mokelumne Hill , CA 95245 . ] During the 1930 ' s , an Austrian civil engineer named Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an ' IMPLOSION TURBINE ' ( German name , ' ZOKWENDLE ' ) , after analyzing erosion , and lack of erosion , in differently shaped waterways , and developing sophisticated mathematical equations to explain it . As described in the book " A Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources " , by Dan A . Davidson , 1977 , water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a CRITICAL VELOCITY . The water then IMPLODES , no longer touching the inside walls of the tubing , and drives the pump , which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC GENERATOR . The device seems to be tapping energy from that of the earth's rotation , via the ' Coriolis effect ' , LIKE A TORNADO . [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY ! ] A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the ' McClintock Air Motor ' ( U . S . Patent # 2,982 , 261 ) , which is a cross between a diesel engine ( it has three cylinders with a compression ratio of 27 to 1 ) and a rotary engine ( with solar and planetary gears ) . It burns NO FUEL , but becomes self-running by driving its own air compressor . This engine also generates a lot of heat , which could be used to heat buildings ; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large trucks , preventing their slowing down when climbing hills . [ David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the automatic transmission , differential , and 4 - wheel drive . ] Crystals may someday be used to supply energy , as shown in the Star Trek shows , perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector . One other energy source should be mentioned here , despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free Energy . A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION reactor which he calls ' Migma ' , which uses NON-radioactive deuterium as a fuel [ available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities from sea water ] , does NOT produce radioactive waste , can be converted DIRECTLY into electricity ( with-OUT energy-wasting steam turbines ) , and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city . And UNLIKE the " Tokamaks " and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about , Migma WORKS , already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in . [ " New Times " ( U . S . version ) , 6-26- 78 , pages 32-40 . ] And then there are the ' cold fusion ' experiments that have been in the news lately , originally conducted by University of Utah researchers B . Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann . Some U . S . Navy researchers at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California , under the direction of chemist Melvin Miles , finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus , had them analyzed with mass-spectrometry techniques , and found HELIUM 4 , which PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place , and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated . There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called " laws " of thermodynamics are NOT so " absolute " . For example , the late Physicist Dewey B . Larson developed a comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , which he calls the ' Reciprocal System ' , ( which he describes in detail in several books such as " Nothing But Motion " ( 1979 ) and " The Universe of Motion " ( 1984 ) ) , in which the physical universe has TWO DISTINCT HALVES , the material half and an anti-matter half , with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing between them , with-OUT the " heat death " predicted by thermodynamic " laws " . His Theory explains the universe MUCH BETTER than modern orthodox theories , including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about , and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way . Some Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow , seemingly converting " low-quality energy " into " high-quality energy " . Also , certain religious organizations such as ' Sant Mat ' and ' Eckankar ' teach their Members that the physical universe is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of existence , like parallel universes , or analogous to TV channels , as described in books like " The Path of the Masters " , by Dr . Julian Johnson , 1939 , and " Eckankar : The Key to Secret Worlds " , by Sri Paul Twitchell , 1969 . For example , the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the ' Astral Plane ' . Long-time Members of these groups have learned to ' Soul Travel ' into these higher worlds and report on conditions there . It seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe , or be created at the boundary between them , given the right configuration of matter to channel it . This is supported by many successful laboratory-controlled experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world , such as those described in the book " Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain " . In terms of economics , the market has FAILED . Inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment , and the conventional energy producer $ have no desire to do so because of their VE $ TED INTERE $ T $ . The government is needed to intervene . If the government does not intervene , then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out , prices for energy will increase , and pollution and its harmful effects ( including the ' GREENHOUSE EFFECT ' , acid rain , smog , radioactive contamination , oil spills , rape of the land by strip mining , etc . ) will continue to increase . The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development of Free Energy by Inventors and universities , subsidize private production ( until the producers can make it on their own ) , and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of Free Energy Hardware . The long-range effects of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound . The quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer $ ( coal mining companie $ , oil companie $ and countries , electric utilitie $ , etc . ) would drop to near zero , forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere . Energy resources ( coal , uranium , oil , and gas ) would be left in the ground . Prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero , while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases ( as happened with VCR's , personal computers , etc . ) . Costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease , along with their prices to consumers . Consumers would be able to realize the " opportunity costs " of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel . Tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars . Government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way . AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR . Many conventional energy producer $ would go out of business , but society as a whole , and the earth's environment and ecosystems , would benefit greatly . It is the People , that government should serve , rather than the big corporation $ and bank $ .

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of " right " and " wrong " ( or " correct / incorrect " or " true / false " ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is " right " ( correct , true , veridical ) or " wrong " ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply can't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the " rightness " of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one cannot feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the " correctness " of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . - - - John A .

Do you mean by " omnipotent " that God should be able to do anything / everything ? This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless . To be descriptive , omnipotence must mean " being all-powerful " and not " being able to do anything / everything " . Let me illustrate by analogy . Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth . Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations . The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit . The US would be militarily " omnipotent " . But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine / philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation , such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states . Technically ( in this scenario ) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess . But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference . If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough , then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated . Effectively , the US would be limited in what it could actually do , although it had the power to do " whatever it wanted " . The US would simply " never want to interfere " for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy . God is effectively limited in the same sense . He is all powerful , but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He , Himself is . I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence .

I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have . At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science . I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians " Creation Science " on any topic . It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran , to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded . It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then " interpret " passages to match those findings . People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time .

You can tell your friend from me that I was in a publisher's warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of The Joy of Cooking and every one of them was syllable-perfect . I have since sold all I own and become a follower of The Joy of Cooking . The incident I mentioned convinced me , once and for all , that The Joy of Cooking is inspired by god and the one true path to his glory .

No , I say religious law applies to those who are categorized as belonging to the religion when event being judged applies . This prevents situations in which someone is a member of a religion who , when charged , claims that he / she was _not_ a member of the religion so they are free to go on as if nothing had happened .

For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all . You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest . It is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to think about . It's not either or . Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind . I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily applied to god and religion . It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning , but there is overwhelming reason every single day , day in and day out , for _everyone_ to put his faith and dogma there .

It does no one any good to deny it . > It only makes the more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting the > bad ones . Can you see that ? I don't deny this fact . The thrust of my argument here is that ( a ) Salameh is , according to US law , innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law . As his guilt has not been established , it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption . ( b ) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents . If Muslims - - who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this - - perform such actions , it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam , but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of Islam . This is an important distinction . I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say " Muslim " . In general , anyone who calls themselves a " Muslim " and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim . Thus , one who might do things contrary to Islam ( through ignorance , for example ) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim . If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles , though , then one does leave Islam . The term " Muslim " is to be contrasted with " Mu'min " , which means " true believer " . However , whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God ( and perhaps that person himself ) . So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism , because it is not known to anybody ( except myself and God ) , whether I , for example , am a " true believer " or not . For example , I could just be putting on a show here , and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here , without anyone knowing . Thus , when we say " Muslims " we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam , whether in practice they might , in ignorance , transgress Islamic teachings . By " Muslim " we do not necessarily mean " Mu'min " , or " true believer " in Islam .

Correct me if I am wrong , but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews .

Either there is some connection between the text , the fact that it exists , and your interpretation of it , or it is purely arbitrary .. Further , the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better . You might answer that one can't becuase some peculiar Biblical information might be lost , but that holds true of every other book , and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place ?

And the argument you have given is a fallacy , while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not , it can be crucial in other questions . Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way , and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god .

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism ; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ . Your generalisms are then misplaced - - atheism needn't imply materialism , or the lack of an absolute moral system . However , I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality , so I'll answer your questions . > How then can an atheist judge value ? An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does : according to a personal understanding of morality . That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one . I'm just explicit , as in the line of postings you followed up , that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad . My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me , be they Christians , Muslims , or atheists . So when I say that I object to genocide , I'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds . If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does , my answer would be mechanistic to your taste - - that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society , and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies , thereby achieving considerable survival advantages . You'd probably say that God just made the rules . Neither of us can convince the other , but we share a common understanding about many moral issues . You think you get it from your religion , I think I get it ( and you get it ) from early childhood teaching . > That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God > or God's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your > nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled > with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books , but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're saying . I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as " God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites " is mechanistic , but of course I think that's true of you as well . My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does , but if a god existed who commanded genocide , I could not consider him good , which is supposedly an attribute of God . > All of this being so , you have excluded > yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , > etc . and cannot participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no > weight whatsoever . Hmm . Yes , I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good . I have as much place discussing values etc . as any other person . In fact , I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion , by framing the questions in terms of reason : for instance , it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands , then the quality of life will be generally poor , so a system that fosters coexistence is superior , if quality of life is an agreed goal . An absolutist , on the other hand , can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with , and say " this is good " , even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion . The attempt to define someone or a group of people as " excluded from discussion " , such that they " cannot participate " , and their opinions given " no weight whatsoever " is the lowest form or reasoning ( ad hominem / poisoning the well ) , and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right , wrong , and the Bible . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

Of course B . M . is not incorrect . He is defending Islam . When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you . But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using " petty sarcasm " . So B . M . can have his " temporary atheists " whenever he needs them and all the " temporary atheists " can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam .

I take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent . You could be right , but it sounds plausible to me . Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand ? Here's some more : Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid - 1700s Indians were not only invited to participate in the deliberations of our " founding fathers , " but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany Plan of Union , and later the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution . That this would be absent from our school texts , and from history , and from media is not surprising given the devotion Americans feel to our founding myth : Great men gathered to express a new vision that has withstood the test of time . If it were revealed that Indians had a role in it , imagine the blow to the American psyche .
   ... By 1754 , when most of these men and others gathered to creat the Albany Plan of Union , the first try at confederation , they invited forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors on confederate structures . Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at Albany Congress : " It would be a strange thing ... if six nations of ignorant savages [ sic ] should be capable of forming such a union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted for ages and appears indissoluble , and yet that a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies . " According to Grinde , Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs and congressional delegates in order to " hammer out a plan that he acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy . " Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde , Jr . , of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation _ addresses this issue . - - Doug Graham dgraham@bnr.ca My opinions are my own .From : danb@shell.portal.com ( Dan E Babcock ) Subject : Re : some thoughts .

Well , I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key ( the motto can be attributed to him ) , but it is at least clear that he believed in a god .

That is to say , the religion of this country , and the non-religion of the USSR . That was what most of those quotes were about , and some included all atheists , in general , as well .

In spite of this , and because of requests for me to post my list o ' nicknames , I must admit that no such list exists .

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation ` Rabbi ' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary ` scripture ' Mat 21:42 Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures ... Mat 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing Mat 22:29 the scriptures , nor the power of God . Following from this , he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies , and the NT says as much : Mat 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , Mat 26:54 that thus it must be ? Mat 26:56 But all this was done , that the scriptures of the Mat 26:56 prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples Mat 26:56 forsook him , and fled .

I have no problem with the second statement . I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey , and was offered by some other people too : essentially , that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom . It's a good point , and I'm thinking about it . # #Your trick is to say , I feel A is not right , and so do many I know , #therefore A is absolutely right . It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process , #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process . In other words , refutes it . You make the ontological #claim , you have to prove it . Nonsense . My " trick " is to say : I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . Best evidence is therefore that A really is better than B , subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B , and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent . Now get this : " really is better " is an idealisation , a fictional model , in the same sense that " real material existence " is a fictional model . It may or may not correspond to something true . It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_ . Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist " trick " , to wit : I feel that A is better than B , and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . However , if even one person disagrees that A is better than B , or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B , then it is the case that B is better than A for that person , and nothing more can be said . I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B ( e . g . a terrorist ) . To do that would be to claim that a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist's - which would , of course , be true , but a no-no for an ethical relativist . To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words , and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion . # > #For a similar argument , I sense morality is subjective , it does not # > #hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by # > #others . # > # > If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively # > wrong , and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this # > is possible .

The term god is used in a different way usually . When you use a different definition it is your thing , but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist , it is existence itself , so I say it does not exist . Interestingly , there are those who say that " existence exists " is one of the indubitable statements possible . Further , saying god is existence is either a waste of time , existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god , or you are implying more with it , in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete , making it a fallacy .

Gillow , who had secretly studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair , first approached the scientific community with his theory in the late 1950 ' s . " The whole hat thing , that was just a cover up . The Vatican didn't want the Catholic Community ( tm ) to realize their leader was hefting nearly 8 kilograms of extraneous bone tissue on the top of his skull . " , notes Gillow in his report . " There are whole laboratories in the Vatican that experiment with tissue transplants and bone marrow experiments . What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400 ' s is now scientifically engineered and bred for . The whole bone transplant idea started in the mid sixties inspired by doctor Timothy Leary transplanting deer bone cells into small white rats . " Gillow is quick to point out the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr . Leary from the public eye . " When it becomes time to replace the pope " , says Gillow , " The old pope and the replacement pope are locked in a padded chamber .

For one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon . Unlike a football . Further , you conveniently ignore here that there are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something . The analogy does not hold . One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a set of morals YOU have to give . Further , the above is evidence , not proof . Proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories .

He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die . By not giving up after getting shot himself , Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes . As far as healing goes . If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels . In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today . Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling , so the stories got bigger to appeal better . -> Niether was he a lunatic . Would more than an entire nation be drawn -> to someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous .

There are bifurcations ( or tri , quad , etc ) that are valid , because in the proceeding steps , the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible . Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are , then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent , and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives . However , if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive , then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid , even if the true choice is one of the original choices . I have given at least one valid alternative , so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid . -> Some other things to note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in -> the psalms , Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone . This in his betrayal -> and Crucifixion .

One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom . # # The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem # > that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem # > to agree that some level of interference is necessary . # #They see the need for a " justice " system .

Note that " ( the celestial bodies ) " in the above verse is an interpolation ( which is why it is in brackets ) - - it is the translator's ( incorrect , IMHO ) interpretation . Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation ( he studied Arabic for his research into the Qur'an and science ) of this verse : " ( God is ) the One Who created the night , the day , the sun and the moon . Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion . " ( Qur'an : 33 ) The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr . Maurice Bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time ( and for a long time afterwards ) , there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse ( or anywhere in the Qur'an ) .

Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have to acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos and biases . Some scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof for the theory .

Not really . I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ( $ 7,500 , 000 I believe ) , especially considering the outcome . My point was that mass suicides in the U . S . are rare ( Jonestown was in Guyana , incidentally , although we footed the bill for the clean-up ) , and the U . S . has far more important issues to address . Compare the number of U .

Thus while I believe that no gods exist , this does ^ ^ ^ > not imply * faith * on my part that it is so . ^ ^ ^ Let me first say that " to believe that no gods exist " is in fact different than " not believing in a god or gods " . I will argue that your latter statement , " I believe that no gods exist " does rest upon faith - that is , if you are making a POSITIVE statement that " no gods exist " ( strong atheism ) rather than merely saying I don't know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then ( weak atheism ) . Once again , to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist . I still maintain the position , even after reading the FAQs , that strong atheism requires faith . But first let me say the following . We might have a language problem here - in regards to " faith " and " existence " . I , as a Christian , maintain that God does not exist . To exist means to have being in space and time . God does not HAVE being - God IS Being . Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist , He is eternal . With this said , I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called " existence " of God - and that is not what I'm doing here . I believe that God is the source and ground of being . When you say that " god does not exist " , I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it . However , in what follows I will use the phrase " the existence of God " in it's ' usual sense ' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it . I would like a clarification upon what you mean by " the existence of God " . We also might differ upon what it means to have faith . Here is what Webster says : faith 1a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b ( 1 ): fidelity to one's promises ( 2 ): sincerity of intentions 2a ( 1 ): belief and trust in and loyalty to God ( 2 ): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b ( 1 ): firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^ ^ ^ ( 2 ): complete trust 3 : something that is believed esp . with strong conviction ; esp : a system ^ ^ ^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist . When you say that you believe God does not exist , and that this is an opinion " based upon observation " , I will have to ask " what observtions are you refering to ? " There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief . All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to ( by predisposed I mean , for example , people whoes partents " believe in God " also tend to ) . To actually draw a conclusion about the " existence " or " non-existence " of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say " I believe that God does / does not exist " . Personally , I think that both statements are misguided . Arguing over the " existence " of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him ( and yes , I use " Him " because a personal God is the only viable concept ( IMO ) - if a person wants to use " She " go ahead . Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise . If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to . ) And please , if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling . If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs , or if they they think I have not read them well enough , just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation .

An interesting question would be if atoms > are objects ( classical ) or phenomenon ( neo-quantum ) or what ? I've been following this train of talk , and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense " not real " leaves me uneasy . It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects , and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real . The tree outside my window is in this category ... is observe the light which bounces off of it , not the tree itself . The observation is indirect , but no more so than observations I have made of atoms . Also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms . I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time . Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either . One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field . What I read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring . Anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it worked .

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is a complete lie and deception , as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving . Liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , almost always at the cost to another . Whos liberty is more inalienable ? Similarly for right of life . When one person must die if he is to save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty , especially for serial killers . Whos life and liberty is more valuable , the serial killer , or the victim ? According to that beautiful line , those two rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able to remove them . This _includes_ government . Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and / or liberty , but is not his own life / liberty inviolate also ?

Assuming you are presenting it accurately , I don't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion . The material in John ( I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here , but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt . / Luke " Q " material ) IS different ; hence , one could have almost any relationship between the two , right up to John getting it straight from Jesus ' mouth . > We are talking date of texts here , not the age of the authors .

It depends on how he defines God . The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science . Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them . Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable , and especially subserviant in a basic way , to religious dogma . This pursuit always fails . > I think I got his point - - I can quote the section if I'm being vague . > The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates .

Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way . It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits . Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers , at best . Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions . More questions can be posed than it can answer . At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction .

You got me thinking now ! This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a move in society to classify previously " socially unacceptable " yet legal activities as OK . In the past it seems to me there were always two coexisting methods of social control . First ( and most explicit ) is legal control . That is the set of actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set of punishments . Secondly ( and somewhat more hidden ) is social control . These are the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered by legal control , are scrictly controled by social censure . Ideally ( if socialization is working as it should ) legal control is hardly ever needed since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of social censure . The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as " guilt " and " morality " . I've heard it said ( and fully believe ) that if it weren't for the VAST majority of people policing themselves , legal control would be absolutely impossible . Lately ( last 50 , 100 years ? ) however there has been a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ( ie . if it ain't illegal , then don't pick on me ) . I'm not saying this is wrong , merely that it is a byproduct of a society which has : 1 ) A high education level , 2 ) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media , 3 ) A high level of institutionalized individual rights , and 4 ) A " me " oriented culture . I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition , here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can \ can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness , yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as those freedoms don't impinge on another's . IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here . While we appreciate and persue individual rights ( these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instincts ) , the removal of socialized , inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the continued destabilization of society . I got no quick fix . I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess . I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms in order to " stabilize " society . Yet I believe development of societies follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability . Can we find a social model which maximizes indiv . freed . ' s yet is stable ? Perhaps it is possible to live with a " non-stable " society ? Anybody see a way out ? Comments ? PS . Therefore answer to question # 3 : We don't . Do we want to ?

King ( king@ctron.com ) posts a whopping one liner : * " The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * * treated as a matter of faith . " - - Francis Hitching * I have a few points to make about the above posting . 1 . Science is not based on and does not consist of " quotes " from either real or alleged experts . Critical reasoning , evidence and ( if possible ) experimentation are necessary . Creationists frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike ( some of the latter quotes are in fact false ) and steadfastly refusing to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure . This strongly suggests that ( a . ) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and ( b . ) they are aware of this fatal deficiency . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 2 . You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his statement . Why is that ? If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology . Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientists . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 3 . Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of " the modern theory of evolution " would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody . It is also important to note that disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid . Creationists seem rather fond of diving ( head first ) into this logical fallacy . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 4 . Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack on evolution ( either the fact or the theory ) really represents an attack on science . While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve ( B ^ ) the fact of evolution will not ever go away . Creationists lost the battle long ago ( more than 100 years in fact ) but are simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant . Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub ( kv07@IASTATE.EDU ) asks : * Neither I , nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings . Who is he ? * I , like Hitchings , am not to be found in Webster's B ^ ) . Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist ( or perhaps he is just playing the part of one ) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ( " The Neck of the Giraffe " ) . In that publication he quotes a creationist ( Jean Sloat Morton ) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance . Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution ( the two are quite independent ) but also concluding with a " non sequitur " ( i . e . the conclusion " does not follow " ) . [ pp 70-71 ] Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism . [ pp 84 ] Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times ( and repeated in the Oregonian ) . The article was titled " ` Giraffe ' sticks scientific neck out too far " . Excerpts include : " Francis Hitchings is not a biologist . " " He goes after Darwin like Mark Antony after Brutus . He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman . " " He suggests a mystical ` organizing principle ' of life , using the similarity of organs in different creatures as evidence [ sic ] . " Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it . If John E . King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't surprise me much .

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex - - one which I personally believe has some truth . My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex . At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that , just that it is plausible . To try to convince you all of this particular point of view , I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field , etc . , in order to gather further evidence , which I simply do not have time to do now . Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is " a prime cause " ( in my opinion ) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems , especially depression , in Western societies . I am not saying it is " the prime cause " or " the only cause " , just " a prime cause " - - i . e . one of the significant contributions to this trend . I think when you say you think my view is simplistic , you have forgotten this - - I admit that there are probably other factors , but I do think that extra-marital sex ( and , IMO , subsequent destabilization of the family ) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century .

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man ' s Religions _ by John B . Noss . It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing . It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading . It doesn't " compare " religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities . But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based . In fact , Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages . The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began ( India , East Asia , Near East ) . There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs , Mayas , Incas , etc . Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays . And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way . If you like the old stuff , then a couple of books called " The Ancient Near East " by James B . Pritchard are pretty cool . Got the Epic of Gilgamesh , Code of Hammurabi , all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods were men .

Actually , it is simple . A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders of X at the time when C was committed .

This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites in Holland . Holland had no anti-cracking legislation , and so it was viewed as a " hacker haven " by some US system administrators . Similarly , a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain . If they were broadcasting in Britain , they would be committing a crime . But they are not , they are broadcasting from Denmark , so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it , in spite of the apparent law-breaking . Of course , I'm not a lawyer , so I could be wrong . More confusingly , I could be right in some countries but not in others ... mathewFrom : keith@cco.caltech.edu ( Keith Allan Schneider ) Subject : Re : Keith Schneider - Stealth Poster ? arromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu ( Ken Arromdee ) writes : > > But , if you were to discuss the merits of racism , or its psycholgical > > benefits , you would do well to have experienced it personally . > When you speak of " experiencing religion " you mean someone should believe in > a religion . That's right , and this is pretty impossible , right ? It would be ideal if we could believe for a while , just to try out religion , and only then determine which course of thought suits us best . But again , this is not possible . Not that religion warrants belief , but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits . There are also some psychological burdens , too . > When you speak of " experiencing racism " , do you mean that someone should > believe in racism , or that they should have racist things done to them ?

Well , if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism , they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually " believing " in racism . Of course , the parallel happens to be a poor one , but you originated it . keithFrom : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Re : Christian Morality is In article <pww-210493010443@spac-at1-59.rice.edu> , pww@spacsun.rice.edu ( Peter > > Simple logic arguments are folly .

I looked back at this , and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed . The US has not sold Iraq any arms . Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels . Their airforce ( not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about ) , doesn't include any US equipment . Their missiles are all non-US . Their tanks are almost all soviet , with about 100 French tanks ( older ones ) . The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s . Those were not sold to Iraq . Iraq captured them from other countries ( like Kuwait ) . Information is hard to prove . You are claiming that the US sold information ? Prove it . Now , how did the US build up Iraq again ? I just gave some fairly conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq . Information is hard to prove , almost certainly if the US did sell information , then that fact is classified , and you can't prove it . If you can provide some useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq , I am very interested , but not if you just make claims based on what " everyone knows " . - - * * * * mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu * Never program and drink beer at the same * * M ^ 2 * time .

What are your thoughts on it ? I read it when it first came out , and the controversy broke . Put my name on the waiting list at the library ( that way if the book was really offensive , none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher ) , and read it , " cover to cover " ( to use a phrase that seems popular here right now ) . And I * liked * it . The writing style was a little hard to get used to , but it was well worth the effort . Coming from a similar background ( Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family , and moved to England ; I grew up in New Delhi ) , it made a strong impression on me . ( And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English : the " yaar " at the end of a sentence , " Butbutbut , " the occasional hindi phrase , etc . ) At the time I still " sorta-kinda " thought of myself as a muslim , and I couldn't see what the flap was all about . It seemed clear to me that this was allegory . It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives , and had not ( as my grandfather thundered ) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes ; in short , every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely . ( And I won't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book . Oops , I just did ! ) Perhaps in a deep sense , the book is insulting to Islam , because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent ? She can come directly to me , can't she ? How do we know that Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something ? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up , or put in their own little verses ? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women , when no other muslim is allowed to ? ( Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say-so of some " holy " guy . Not to mention murder the author . ) > Over the years , when I have made this point , various primarily muslim > posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book > and had called it such things as " filth and lies " , " I would rank > Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse " , and so on . I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book . A really silly argument - after all , how many of these same people have read " Mein Kampf ? " It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of ? Why don't they just read the book and decide for themselves ?

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank - what will someone bet me they weren't " real " Islamic owners and operators ? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive depositors . And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down the street ?

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity . It is surprising to note that a large majority of people , at least in Finland , seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland , religious people are actually a minority . Could it be possible that many people believe in god " just in case " ? It seems people do not want to seek the truth ; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments . A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly . The majority doesn't care - it believes , but doesn't know what or how . People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle , they only want to keep the virtual gate open . A Christian would say that they are not " born in the Spirit " , but this does not disturb them . Religion is not something to think about . I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream . Religions have a strong appeal to people , nevertheless - a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to . Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop , too many people take the poison with a smile .

Right . Unfortunately for you , it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too . I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy , too .

As I understand it , that is not the case ; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people . > civilians suffer .
