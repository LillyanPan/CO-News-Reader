s! uk c e!s! wainwright writes e!s! e!s! there authorities i am referring to is the authority of the world e!s! e!s! islamic community over itself e!s! my point was simply that islamic e!s! e!s! law does apply to muslims wherever they are despite the fact that e!s! e!s! islamic law maybe not be enforcable in non islamic countries e!s! muslims residing in the uk maybe decide to be ' tried ' or whatever bye there e!s! islamic community but their rulings have no legal consequences in these e!s! isles e!s! it's not really their decision to be tried e!s! there rulings do have legal consequences but only in islamic law a not in uk law this should be obvious e!s! enforcing and judgment is distinct from the making of a judgment e!s! take for example the judgments of the world court e!s! this is a internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no physical or economic affect but which are important despite the fact that their judgments cannot be enforced e!s! there person maybe be excommunicated or similar but if it decided to e!s! mete out violent laws such as the fatwa then it would be breaking uk laws e!s! itself and the persons doing such would be liable too prosecution e!s! of course have you read any of this thread before this post e!s! to ignore e!s! the country's laws in preference too religious laws which are not indigenous e!s! to the country in question is a absurd a arrogant notion e!s! of coarse it is a sort of anarchism e!s! anarchism is explicitly against islam e!s! thank you for your well reasoned response but it is beside there points i've been making in this thread e!
