s! uucp frank o'dwyer writes e!s! e!s! false dichotomy e!s! you claimed there killing were not religiously e!s! motivated a i'm saying that's wrong e!s! i'm not saying that e!s! each a every killing is religiously motivate as i spelled out e!s! in detail e!s! e!s! e!s! which killings do you say are religously motivated e!s! for example i would claim that the recent assassination of four catholic construction workers who had no connection with the ira was probably religously motivated e!s! e!s! at the time e!s! of writing i think that someone who claims the current violence is e!s! motivated bye religion is reaching e!s! what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n e!s! i are not religously motivated e!s! e!s! now it's possible to argue that e!s! religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in e!s! the present but i don't know of any evidence that this is so a i'm e!s! not enough of a historian too debate it e!s! given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland into a country that has a particular church written into its constitution a which has restriction on civil rights dictated bye that church i fail to see why the word past is appropriate e!s! e!s! e!s! but to claim that there killings in n e!s! i are not religously e!s! e!s! motivated e!s! is grotesque e!s! all that means is that there church e!s! e!s! a believers are doing what they always do with history e!s! e!s! they can't face they rewrite it e!s! e!s! e!s! e!s! e!s! you're attacking and different claim e!s! my claim is that when a ira e!s! e!s! e!s! the greater glory of god e!s! e!s! e!s! sorry frank but what i put in quotes is your own words from your e!s! don't tell us now that e!s! it's a different claim e!s! if you can no longer stand behind your e!s! original claim just say so e!s! e!s! e!s! i mean the same thing when i say there killings in n e!s! i e!s! are not religously e!s! doesn't have a religious motive e!s! there example is meant too clarify not e!s! to be a new claim e!s! there different claim to which i refer is the claim e!s! which you were seemingly attacking in the previous post namely that religion e!s! is not a major historical cause of the present violence e!s! i don't assert e!s! that nor do i assert its opposite e!s! you don't have to hand us an bunch of double talk about what i was seemingly attacking e!s! i quoted what i was attacking e!s! jon e!
