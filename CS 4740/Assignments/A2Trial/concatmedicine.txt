I do not believe that this is > yet a standard part of medical practice . Nor is it mine . What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections . Marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists . Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this . At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining " good " anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group . I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea ( that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora ) . However , it is NOT part of my routine practice to " reinnoculate " patients with " good " bacteria after antibiotics . I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients . Whether or not it is a " logical extension " from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials . One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C . difficile colitis ( NOT a fungal infection ) . There are case reports of using stool ( ie someone elses ) enemas to repopulate the patients flora . Don't try this at home . > not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams .

The three active-treatment regimens and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms ( P less than 0.001 ) , but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo . [ . . . ] CONCLUSIONS . In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome , nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo . Consequently , the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted . Does this trial address every issue raised here , no . Jon Noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn't use * Sporanox * ( despite Crook's recommendation for Nystatin ) .

Marty , you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms ( Noring syndrome ) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis ( Elaine Palmer syndrome ) with systemic symptoms . There is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials . Are we talking about " real " candida infections , the whole " yeast connection " hypothesis , the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans , or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies ( challenged by a negative randomized trial ) to confirm an etiologic hypothesis ( post hoc ergo propter hoc ) .

I am very pleased with the results . The catalog description is as follows : The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur . The powerful motor drives two counter-rotating " thumbs " that move in one-inch orbits - - releasing tension in the neck , back , legs and arms . Pressure Point Massager A2623 $ 109 To order or receive a catalog , call ( 24 hours , 7 days ) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021 . * * * NOTE : When I ordered the massager , the item number was different , and the price was $ 179 , not $ 109 . When I received it , I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one . I was QUITE annoyed to see a $ 70 difference in price . I called them about it , and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks and works exactly the same . He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one , using the price difference as a reason for return . In fact , since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory ( I received this one in 3 days ) , he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives , then return the old one . VERY reasonable people . * * * I have long-term neck , shoulder and back pain ( if I were a building , I would be described as " structurally unsound :-) ) . I have stretches and exercises to do that help , but the problem never really goes away . If , for whatever reason , I do not exercise for a while ( illness , not enough time , lazy , etc . ) , the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone to further strain . Even with exercise , I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track , which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p . t . The tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache ( sometimes confused with a sinus headache ) over my left eye . When my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub-occipital muscles in particular ( the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull ) , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged . I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent - - a machine that would massage , NOT VIBRATE , my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that I could use by myself . No doctor visit or inconvenient p . t . appts for a week later would be needed to use it . I could get up in the middle of the night and use it , if necessary . I have been using it for about a week or so now , and LOVE it . The base unit is about a 14 " x 9 " rectangle , about 3-3 / 4 " high , with handles on each side , and it plugs into an average outlet . The two metal " thumbs " are about 1-1 / 2 " in diameter and protrude about 2-1 / 2 " above the base . The thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable . They are located more toward one end , rather than centered ( see figure below ) . They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet . It can be used from either side . For instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it . ___ | __ ___ __ | | | | | | | | | | | | | \ ^ ^ / \ ^ ^ / | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ___ | | | | | | __ | | __ | | | ___ | For the neck / head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by ( if laying down ) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and / or neck to rest on the thumbs . The handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with the arms / wrists . Since my wrists are also impaired ( I'm typing this over an extended period of time ) , and I don't have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me . For my back , I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair , position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged , and lean back lightly ( or not so lightly ) against it . The pressure of leaning back holds it in place . If I want to massage the entire spine , I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it . For my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used " home-made " massager of 2 tennis balls taped together ( with the balls , position ( against a wall or door ) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them ) . The tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets ( painfully ) in the way if I don't pin it up first . As far as I'm concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely I'll use / do it . If there are multiple considerations / hassles , I'm more likely to not bother with it . Not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased . The first time I used it on my neck / sub-occipital muscles , however , I overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days . I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped . After that , I was more gradual about applying pressure . At this point , the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me . It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging ( just a few minutes at a time ) to really work it out . I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although I cannot vouch for its durability ( it seems pretty sturdy ) , since I've had it such a short time . I plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising ( and maybe after , too ) . I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks , so this was very timely for me . This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker . The catalog states they have been in business since 1976 . It contains quite a few health care products and , while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products , they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do . Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as " Dr . Leonards Health Care Catalog " or " Mature Wisdom " . I'm only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists ( no big surprise here :-) ) . I consider many of those products to be rip-offs , particularly targeted toward the elderly , with dubious health benefits . I apologize for the length of this , but it's the kind of info _I_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail .

I first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago , and I have just got hold of a book , " How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation " , by Margaret D . Corbett , ( ' Authorized instructor of the Bates method ) , published in 1953 . It talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise . Has there been any study on whether this method actually works ? If it works , is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball , or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball ? Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation , seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process , i . e . , shorten it somehow ( preferably non-surgically ) . Has there been any recent studies on this ? Where can I find them ? I know RK works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball , but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better ( Bates's idea , right ? ) Thanks for any information .From : dpc47852@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Daniel Paul Checkman ) Subject : Re : Is MSG sensitivity superstition ? dyer@spdcc.com ( Steve Dyer ) writes : > In article <1qnns0$4l3@agate.berkeley.edu> spp@zabriskie.berkeley.edu ( Steve Pope ) writes : > > The mass of anectdotal evidence , combined with the lack of > > a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving > > the hypothesis , makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the > > most likely explanation for events . > You forgot the smiley-face . > I can't believe this is what they turn out at Berkeley .

Make a decision about whether you * really * want to be a medical doctor . I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted . Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself ; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents / family / significant other . If you still want to be a medical doctor , determine how you can improve your application . A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a ' big-shot ' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face . Also , don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation ; give them a chance to say ' no , sorry ' instead of the medical school saying ' no , sorry ' . I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments , and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point . Rewrite your personal statement ; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism , both about what you are saying as well as how you say it . Review your academic accomplishments . If your grades are poor in some area , don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework . Evidence of determined committment will help here . If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses , it usually shows . Look at your extracurricular involvements . Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus ; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also . Beware of ' resume padding ' ; such things are not difficult to spot and weed out . Overall , a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there , combined with an honest self-appraisal of skills and aptitude , will be the best path to take in applying to any program , medical or what-have-you .

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy , even in the presence of a hymen . I doubt that sperm could make it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum , but it might be possible . So , it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant .

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis . Previously , low residue diets were recommended , but this advice has now changed . Also , there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining , so input by the physician will be important .

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's ( relatively ) cheap and when taken orally , non-toxic . But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect , so unless it were given IV , it would be without any effect on your sinuses . I wish these quacks would first use IV nystatin or amphotericin B on people like you .

I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did . ___ [ Reprinted w / o permission ] " There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors ' salaries " By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services On a stupidity scale , a recent poll about doctors ' earnings is right up there . It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10 . It was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called Families USA . The poll tells us that the majority of Americans believe that doctors make too much money . The pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians . Those polled said , oh , about $ 80,000 a year would be OK . How generous . How sporting . How stupid . Why is this poll stupid ? Because it is based on resentment and envy , two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering . You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $ 100,000- plus and get the same results . Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks , they assume that those who do are stealing it from them . Maybe the Berlin Wall came down , but don't kid yourself . Karl Marx lives . It's also stupid because it didn't ask key questions , such as : Do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician ? If those polled said no , they didn't know , then they should have been disqualified . If they gave the wrong answers , they should have been dropped . What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor ? Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way : " How much should a person earn if he or she must ( a ) get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to ( b ) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math , physics , chemistry , and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better , and ( c ) spend four more years of grinding study in medical school , with the third and fourth years in clinical training , working 80 to 100 hours a week , and ( d ) spend another year as a low-pay , hard-work intern , and ( e ) put in another three to 10 years of post-graduate training , depending on your specialty and ( f ) maybe wind up $ 100,000 in debt after medical school and ( g ) then work an average of 60 hours a week , with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or more until they retire or fall over ? " As you have probably guessed by now , I have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of Clinton and Clinton , and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake America's health care . Based on what doctors contribute to society , they are far more useful than the power-happy , ego-tripping , program-spewing , social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality . But propaganda works . And , as the stupid poll indicates , many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs . Of course doctors are well-compensated . They should be . Americans now live longer than ever . But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers , Congress , or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's ? And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self-indulgent , lard-butted , TV-gaping couch cabbages . Ah , that is not something you heard President Clinton or Super Spouse talk about during the campaign or since . But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain , they might have been more honest if they had said : " Let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have . That problem is you , my fellow American . Yes , you , eating too much and eating the wrong foods ; many of you guzzling too much hooch ; still puffing away at $ 2.50 a pack ; getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch ; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world ; filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims ; engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure . " You and your habits , not the doctors , are the single biggest health problem in this country . If anything , it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do . " In fact , I don't understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day . " So as your president , I call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly . Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy - greasy with double fries . Do as I say , not as I do . " But for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid , there is another solution : Don't use them . That's right . You don't feel well ? Then try one of those spine poppers , needle twirlers , or have Rev . Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit . Or there is the do-it-yourself approach . You have chest pains ? Then sit in front of a mirror , make a slit here , a slit there , and pop in a couple of valves . You're going to have a kid ? Why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have ( while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn ) ? Just have the kid the old-fashioned way . Squat and do it . And if it survives , you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots .

Children diagnosed with ADD who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and social skills , which in fact continue to decline .

I don't think it is a reaction to sugar or junk food per se since Kathryn has never shown any signs of hyperactivity or changes in behavior in response to food . She has always been very calm and dare I say , a neat , smart kid . The fact that this happened while eating two sugar coated cereals made by Kellog's makes me think she might be having an allergic reaction to something in the coating or the cereals . Of the four of us in our immediate family , Kathryn shows the least signs of the hay fever , running nose , itchy eyes , etc . but we have a lot of allergies in our family history including some weird food allergies - nuts , mushrooms . Anyway , our next trip is to an endocrinologist to check out the body chemistry . But so far , no more sugar coated cereals and no more seizures either .

One of the most important ( and difficult ) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context , scope , and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim .

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections . I can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms , while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms .

The doubters may be surprised . ( It has happened before . ) I realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another .

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that " it would not be legal in the U . S . " . I think that naturally occuring substances ( excluding " controlled " substances ) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food , food additives or other " consumption " . It's only when the chemists concoct ( sp ? ) an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations . Otherwise , if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything . How in the world do you suppose it's legal to " consume " tobacco products ( which probably SHOULD be banned ) ? Dave Allen Space Science & Engr . Ctr .

I saw this a few years ago on " Tomorrow's World " ( low-brow BBC technology news program ) . The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned . High intensity pressure waves are generated by an electric spark in the water ( you don't get electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct ) . These waves are focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to break up . This is completely painless .

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication . A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity , and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis . If I recall correctly , the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine , which is a highly reactive intermediate , which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione . When hepatic glutathione is used up , this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis . The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay ( 2-4 days ) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage . This is NOT a nice way to die . As to taking 20-30 of these tablets , that comes to 5-7 . 5 grams of acetaminophen . In a normal adult , this would probably cause nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and loss of appetite .

Now I know this is debatable , but please don't nominate him again . If anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list , please drop me a line . = = = That was two years ago . Since then , I have received a grant from Science Culture Canada , a division of Supply and Services Canada to research the book . Since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 - 14 ( though this may change again ) It will have about 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text / graphic boxes all around on the following subjects : Vital statistics and photo of the scientist , Personal statement from the scientist , Narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist , " What I was doing when I was 12 " , So you want to be a < insert kind of scientist > , Experiment you can do . There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads . The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness . I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well . The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well . I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it . Hope to find one soon . I would like to again ask for more nominations , especially in the pure sciences of Physics , Chemistry and Biology . Also criticisms of the list are welcomed . Also women and French-Canadian scientists are needed . I hope this posting will get others to nominate more Great Canadian Scientists , and to discuss what is " great " what is " Canadian " and what is " scientist " .

But colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function . Each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his / her gut . Diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics . A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes . Cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this " treatment " since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient " treatments " . Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments ( more clostly but much safer ) . Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an OR ( mask , gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients ) . Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket . His much higher fees do not drive away patients . I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure . For very little , if any benefit , you subject yourself to hepatitis , cholera , parasitic disease and even HIV . Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment ? Could they be having GI distress ? Could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism ? Could I get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients ?

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root - Bernstein . See his book , " Discovering " . Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule ' , after him , and at the same time as him . The current models do not resemble Kekule's . Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more . I don't think " extra-scientific " is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science , except as a proposed definiens . Extra-rational is a better phrase . In fact , there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction . For example , Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers ( the origin of stereochemistry ) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action . The friend was wrong , but Pasteur's discovery stood . A prior investigator ( Mitscherlich ) , looking at the same phenomenon , had missed a crucial detail ; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric ( now we say : d-tartaric ) acid . Again , Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers ( tartaric acid again ) not because of some rational conviction , but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid . His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the " Newton of mirror-image life , " which he never admitted publically . Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes . Avery started this work because of one of his students , and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian , defended Fred Griffiths ' discoveries in mice . Most of Griffiths ' critics were French , which decided the issue for the student . Avery told him to replicate Griffiths ' work in vitro , which the student eventually did , whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which , in 15 or so years , produced the famous discovery ( Avery , MacLeod , and McCarty , JEM 1944 ) . - - Mark A .

Burzynski's work is not too promising . None of his A - 1 through A - 5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer . The NCI conducted tests of A - 2 and A - 5 against leukemia in mice , with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it . ( These were in 1983 and 1985 ) Burzynski claims that A - 10 is the active factor common to all of A - 1 and A - 5 ( something which he has not shown , A - 10 has only been extracted from A - 2 . He also hasn't shown that A - 1 through A - 5 are actually distinct substances ) . The NCI conducted a series of tests using A - 10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes : leukemia , non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer , colon cancer , cancer of the central nervous system , melanoma , ovarian cancer and renal cancer . A - 10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested . It is necessary to process A - 10 since it is not soluble ( Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents ) , but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG ( which he calls AS 2.5 ) . PAG is not an information carrying peptide , something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity . AS 2.1 ( also derived from A - 10 ) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG . PA ( also not a peptide ) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $ 0.09 a gram . A - 10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide , both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy . The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known . In spite of this similarity , A - 10 does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy . Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory , early research , past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue . sdb - - - sdb@ssr.comFrom : jfare@53iss6.Waterloo.NCR.COM ( Jim Fare ) Subject : Re : Endometriosis In article <1993Apr16.032251.6606@rock.concert.net> naomi@rock.concert.net ( Naomi T Courter ) writes : > can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis ? i heard > it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names > ... > - - Naomi Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist outside the uteris .

If I had to choose , I'd much > rather have the persistant type . Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything . Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical , biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular carcinoma . Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis ( CPH ) are probably the result of a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined . The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy . It consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis . But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) there is no periportal inflammation , bridging necrosis , or fibrosis . CPH has , indeed , an excellent prognosis . If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH . However , as David pointed out , the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it . The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal , with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH . Maybe it is a sampling problem . Maybe it is a continuum .

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems . The digestive processing idea is changing , but if a food causes problems , avoid them . Be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause . Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize . There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber . It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's .

Yes , there is such a thing as eye dominance , although I am not sure if this dominance refers to perscription strength .

What would this effect be called ? Have these effects > ever been studied ? How common are these effects ? Thank you in > advance for all replies . These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments . Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are " blind " in various ways . Some of these are : o The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a placebo or the test treatment , i . e . , whether they are in the control group or the test group . o Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment . o Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment . Obviously , at the point at which the data is analyzed , one has to differentiate the test group from the control group . But the analysis is quasi-public : the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it . It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals , such as mice , there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not " blind " themselves . It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are , though it is important that in all respects except the one tested , the control and test groups are treated alike .

This is a definite temptation . Harumph . Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to . :-) I can't really argue with your logic , though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of one . Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true , it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease . By your logic , I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money , rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine . I have no idea how sincere these guys are , but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment .

OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression . Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one ( though not accompanied by anger ) , or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts . Generally , the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities . The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind , rather than being from an external source . Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing , or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety . In OCD , the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual , take an hour or more per day , and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships . Treatments include psychotherapy , behavioral methods , and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions .

The anes . went out , supposedly to call the on-call anes . In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes . had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call . It was the only time during my labor that I swore . The on-call anes . took 20 minutes to get there .

Then , I got pneumonia , and for some reason , the Lopid stopped working very well ; cholesterol and triglycerides soared . The levels might have stabilized over time , but a new doctor had me quit , wait a month , then switch to Mevicore . On Mevicore , my total cholesterol was down to 207 , LDL was 108 , and HDL was 35 ; but the trig's were still very high , around 318 , and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal , SGOT = 83 ( N = 1-35 ) , GGTP ( ? hard to read copy ) = 42 ( N = 0 - 35 ) . He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern , and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures . He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ( " Just to be extra cautious , though I'm sure it's not a problem . " ) , and wants me to go back on it after that . I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice , and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do . But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of .

WFL - - Walter LundbyFrom : sharon@world.std.com ( Sharon M Gartenberg ) Subject : From Srebrenica : " Doctoring " in Hell SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA , Bosnia , Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August . But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war , he considers himself a surgeon . ` ` Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice . But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have . ' ' Evacuated by the U . N . this week to his home town of Tuzla , the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there . ` ` I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica . All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce , ' ' he told reporters . Mujanovic , 31 , had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla , but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own . Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times , relying on books for guidance , amputating arms and legs 150 times , usually without anesthetic , delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections . He worked 18 - to - 19 - hour days , slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug . 5 and treated 4,000 patients . He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla , 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica . About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain , he said . His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field , killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102 . Half of the dead were women and children . The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer . ` ` There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street , ' ' he said . ` ` There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together . One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead . They had no heads . ' ' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable , he said . Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools , facilities and medicine . The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did . ` ` They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs . ' ' Once he arrived the situation improved , he said , but by mid-September he had run out of supplies . ` ` Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands , ' ' he said . Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding . ` ` People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations , ' ' he said . Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types . ` ` I felt destroyed psychologically , ' ' Mujanovic said . The situation improved after Dec . 4 , when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres . But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region . ` ` Every day we had air strikes and shellings . ' ' Then the hunger set in . Between mid-December and mid-March , when U . S . planes began air dropping food , between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition , he said . ` ` I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation , ' ' he said .

For If you do a MEDLINE search on " turmeric " you'll see that it is a potent lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas . I'm in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs . a $ 2000 bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused Langendorff sheep heart .

L . acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free . Most of the commercial yogurt sold in the U . S . has a very low L . acidophilus and L . bulgaricus count . Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem . Gordon R . has told me through e-mail that he gives his patients L . acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes ( which set-up shop in the colon ) but he hasn't told me which ones yet . The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance ( mouth , anus , sinus cavity and vagina ) . Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina . I have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms . I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body . I'm not ready to buy that yet . I do believe that complications at specific sites ( vagina , anal and maybe lower colon , sinus and mouth ) can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked . Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way ( in my opinion ) to get rid of the problem . Anti-fungals , a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the pH to basically starve the candida out .

Well , maybe I'm getting picky , but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in , the other being the mold form . Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds , depending on environment .

Check out #27903 , just some 20 posts before your own . Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses ? Yet again , the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of . For cites on MSG , look up almost anything by John W . Olney , a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development . It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive , and that its major constituent , glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain ( humans included ) . Too much in the diet , and the system gets thrown off . Glutamate and aspartate , also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , and are freely available in many foods , but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food . By eating lots of junk food , packaged soups , and diet soft drinks , it is possible to jack your blood levels so high , that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous * real * physi 9logical effects .

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study ( search for " life events " in any recent version of Adiposity 101 ) . The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused the weight gain in the first place . This is critical because someone who gains weight because of something temporary ( drug effect , life event , etc . ) may appear successful at dieting when the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary condition that caused the weight gain . - - Chuck Forsberg WA7KGX ... ! tektronix ! reed ! omen ! caf Author of YMODEM , ZMODEM , Professional-YAM , ZCOMM , and DSZ Omen Technology Inc " The High Reliability Software " 17505 - V NW Sauvie IS RD Portland OR 97231 503-621-3406From : battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu ( Laurence Gene Battin ) Subject : Re : Krillean Photography In article <1993Apr26.204319.11231@ultb.isc.rit.edu> , E .

This indicates confusion between " proof " and the process > of doing science . You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make . I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the * process * of science and the end result . As an end result of science , one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable . But there is nothing objective about the * process * of science . If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies , this would certainly be valuable information . But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science . This is where you and I disagree with Turpin . In order to have science , one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense , not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses . Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science , but they are merely the culmination of scientific research . The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING . Without this , one does not have any hypotheses worth testing . ( No , hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data . Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window . At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand . ) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology . It depends on the quality of their THINKING . It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies . And it bothers me even more that there are many fields , such as certain parts of psychology , where there seems to be no thinking at all , but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses . And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes . Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere . - - In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnetFrom : sjha+@cs.cmu.edu ( Somesh Jha ) Subject : What is " intersection syndrome " near the forearm / wrist ?

Candida can do that to you . :-) Gordon , I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L . Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L . acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen ( just like it does in the vagina ) . As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L . acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections , I'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out . The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window . Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials ? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene ( and a very important one ) . The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand , especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely ( like it is in animal husbandry ) .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four , said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases . Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled " Emerging Infectious Diseases " to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report , which has a wide circulation in the health community . The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments . " This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it , " said Dr . Ruth Berkelman , deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases . There were more cases of malaria in the U . S . in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s , and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic , the first in this century , she said . Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem . " We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past " Berkleman said . She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment . " Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem , infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States , " the CDC said . It cited the emergence since the 1970s of a " myriad " of newly identified pathogens and syndromes , such as Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , a deadly bacterial infection ; the hepatitis C virus ; HIV , the virus that causes AIDS ; Legionnaires disease ; Lyme disease ; and toxic shock syndrome . " The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control , such as cholera , malaria and tuberculosis , have increased in many areas , " the CDC said . It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance . = = = * = = = SOURCE : WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE : 04/15 / 93 , pB1 HEADLINE : Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage : legal liability . A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease , a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death . The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property . The decision by U . S . District Judge Robert J . Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad . Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job . He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $ 560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering , in addition to medical expenses and lost wages . Summer camps , schools , companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas , and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling , says Stephen L . Kass , an attorney at New York law firm Berle , Kass & Case , who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability . Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable . Lawsuits for insect bites , while rare , aren't unheard-of . A summer vacationer in Southampton , N . Y . , last year sued the owner of the home she rented , claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever . In 1988 , also on Long Island , a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $ 3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee , causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia . The judge later threw out the award , citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant . But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country - - it's most prevalent in New England , the Middle Atlantic states , Wisconsin , Minnesota and the Northwest - - may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one . The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease . Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years . Payments in worker's-compensation cases , however , are limited to medical costs and lost earnings . The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages , because it involved the question of negligence . Unlike the worker's compensation process , the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and , as a result , for additional payments for pain and suffering . Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease . Ira M . Maurer , a partner at New York law firm Elkind , Flynn & Maurer , who represented the rail workers , says the decision will help to establish " the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease . " Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision , winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult . For one thing , victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite . Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad , even though none of the men remembered being bitten . The workers , who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects , said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites . A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal . The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees . The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites . Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners , such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness . Earlier this week , the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease . And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes . Because of health and safety concerns , some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease . Last year , at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes , N . J . , Becton , Dickinson & Co . began using Damminix , a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc . of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease . The medical - supply company's headquarters include a 120 - acre park , and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected . Ruth Lister , a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis , says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks . And Carole Katz , a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association , says her group spends $ 30,000 each year to treat their 100 - acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide . = = = * = = = TITLE : Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease . AUTHORS : Chancellor MB ; McGinnis DE ; Shenot PJ ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH , Department of Urology , Jefferson Medical College , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . REFERENCE : J Urol 1993 Jan ; 149 ( 1 ): 26-30 Lyme disease , which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae . We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction . Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2 . Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient . We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme disease : 1 ) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2 ) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract . In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy . Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted . Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common . Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B . burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended .

Flights of fancy , and other irrational approaches , are common . The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies ; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments . I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work ; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was , prior to the consumption of a few beers . ( Simple example : Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments . He got very excited , hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes . This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays . The result was a well-conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome . Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy , it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome . On the other hand , the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated ; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized ; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created . Other species have different sets of transposons . Fortunately for me , Warren and I used to eat dinner at T . G . I . Fridays all the time . ) > It further at least implicitly advances the position that > sciences goes " forward " ( and it is not clear what this means given the > context in which it occurs ) by generating in a completely non-rational > and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then > weeded out via the " critical function " of science . I'm not sure that it's random . But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses . If you are really working in an unknown area , it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true ; under those circumstances , the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have . If they are wrong , you will find out soon enough ; but at least , you will find out _something_ . If you try to do experiments at random , with no prior conceptions at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . > ( Though why this critical > function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery . Unfortunately , the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces . Then we get varieties of pathological science : Lysenko , Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene , cold fusion , and so forth . > If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are > subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true > of the application of any " critical function " concerning replication . > This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an " anything goes " view . ) I don't agree that this follows . In fact , this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend . It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process . Failures there are aplenty , but , on the whole , things work out . Another point : there are a couple of senses of the phrase ` ` experimental design ' ' . I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_ , not design . Alexander Fleming ( Proc . Royal Soc . , 1922 ) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons ( Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea ; Fleming probably thought runny bottom , runny nose , what the hell , it's worth a try . ) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like ; in fact , he found lysozyme . > True , the generation part * can * be totally irrational . But typically it is > * not * . Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have > resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply > do not generalize well to the actual history of science . It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs . irrational . Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons , or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds . The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole . - - Mark A .

Both courses , Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese , are ten week , ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study . They begin June 7 and end August 13 . The courses meet five days per week , five hours per day . There is a flat rate tuition charge of $ 1600 per course . Fellowships available for science and engineering students . Contact Steven Brener , Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program , at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below . ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY , THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS . # # # # # # New Program Announcement # # # # # # JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program ( JSTMP ) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University . Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994 . PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States . It is also designed to let scientists , engineers , and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development . This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts . PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program , participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture . Correspondingly , JSTMP consists of three major components : 1 . TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered , including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time . 2 . EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology .

Miller ) Subject : Immunotherapy for Recurrent Miscarriage Following a series of miscarriages , my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells . ( The theory as I understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a " foreign " body . Where this blocking is deficient , the body evicts the " intruder " , resulting in a miscarriage . The white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability . ) Following the transfusion , she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term , and Jake is now an active 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk . We're now thinking about having another child , but no one ( including the OBGYN who supervised the first transfusion ) really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies .

I would appreciate any comments about this and other ' new ' technology for hearing aids . The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT & T and appears to take a different approach from other aids . It appears to me that a new ' programmable ' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible ( and programmable ) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in ' noisy ' situations . The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies ( splitting point is programmable ) , apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies , while the important consonant information ( unfortunately for me ) is in the high frequencies . The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable . They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call ' abnormal growth of loudness ' . This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience , though I think the phrase is missleading . What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss , the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the ' too loud ' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge . This means that if you just boost all sound levels , you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses . Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point . You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum ( specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff ) . Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor ' compress ' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components . Particularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations . - Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USAFrom : bytor@cruzio.santa-cruz.ca.us Subject : Lupus I have a friend who has just been diagnosed with Lupus , and I know nothing about this disease .

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising . That's not what I'd quibble about . What I'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment ; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons , but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem . It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts ; that's too bad if it is so . One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's ( and other people's ) notes , and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations . Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life , but the dreams are right there in his notebooks ( finally public after many years ) , ready for anyone to read . And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results ; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim ( I disproved the claim ) . Of course , Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety : where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment , but turns out to be right in the end . Mark - - Mark A .

I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts . Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet , as is heart disease and cancer . When I give dietary advise , it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group ( or Sci . Med . Nutrition where I do most of my posting ) to avoid seeing a doctor . Nothing can be further from the truth . Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out . But once it is , diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance . Same thing with heart disease and cancer , if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases , don't use what I'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor . You have to go . Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program ( but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here ) . When my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say , don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it . Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician , plan and simple . If it's begnin ( which most are ) fine , then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring . But let me tell you right now , if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns , get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you ( better yet , have a mammography done on a regular basis , my wife kept putting her's off , both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done ) . Her gynocologist even scheduled one , but she didn't show up ( too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa ) . One more thing , I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist . This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease . There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body . But you talk about flying blind , man this is really blind treatment . No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used . I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money , it may well be . But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan , the two M . D's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook . My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress . That's where I'm coming from folks . Blast away if you want , I'm not going to change . Put me in your killfile if you want , I really don't care . I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I've got something important to say . But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind . That's life . Chromium is one of the trace elements . It has a very limited ( but very important ) role in the body . It is used to form glucose tolerance factor ( GTF ) . GTF is made up of chromium , nicinamide ( niacin ) , glycine , cysteine and glutamic . Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF . Some foods already have GTF ( Liver , brewers or nutritional yeast , and black pepper ) . When chromium is in GTF , a pretty good absorption is seen ( about 20 % ) . But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate ( chromium picolinate ) it's absorption is much lower ( 1 to 2 % , lowest for all the minerals ) . I've been posting in Misc . Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a " fat burner " . Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm . I wouldn't do it though . The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day . The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his / her diet . Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency . I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one , there also seems to be a negative one as well . I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability . When yeast ( GTF ) is used , good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative . In addition to Type II diabetes , chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma , again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease , this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising . Glucoma is a little more interesting . Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function . If this eye focusing activity is impaired ( by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response ) , intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated . In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma , the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium . J . Am . Coll . Nutr . 10 ( 5 ): 536 , ( 1991 ) . But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements . For one thing , just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts ( yeast ) . Since glucoma is often found in older people , it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC's . If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma , that would prompt some attention . I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma . You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis . Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium . There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you , but I wouldn't use them . There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now . Here's Weinsier and Morgan , advise on chromium . They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available ( they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either , and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs ) . This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum , it will . What then do they suggest ? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium ( run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation ) . Once you make the diagnosis , put the patient on 200ug of CrCl 3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day . What's my advise ? Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight ( they just do not work that way ) . If you want to take them and then exercise , that would be great . Do include yeast as part of your diet ( most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet ) . If you do have a poor glucose tolerance , ask your doctor to check your chromium status . When he or she says , " what in the world are you talking about " , just say , please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance . If you can't do that , I'll find a doctor who can , thank you very much .

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn / Lakatos / Feyerabend view of " progress " and " rationality " in science . Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past , I won't go into them again now . What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression ( and you may not in fact hold this view ) that the common ( perhaps even the " correct " ) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds . It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes " forward " ( and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs ) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the " critical function " of science . ( Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery . If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of the application of any " critical function " concerning replication . This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an " anything goes " view . ) True , the generation part * can * be totally irrational . But typically it is * not * . Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science . - - Gary H .

I was there in 1976 . I suppose it must have died out since 1946 , then . Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS . Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths . A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor .

Interesting statements , simply because I have been told otherwise . I'm certainly not questioning Steve's claims , as for one I am not a doctor , and I agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's . But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food . Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection ( is that a good enough caveat :-) , I was told that a * LOW RESIDUE * diet is called for . Basically , the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut ( which may not be realized by the patient ) , any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate , thus exacerbating the problem . Therefore , anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided . With what I've been told is typical Crohn's , of the terminal ileum , my diet should be low residue , consisting of : Completely out - never again - items : o corn ( kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-) o popcorn ( same ) o dried ( dehydrated ) fruit and fruit skins o nuts ( Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-) Discouraged greatly : o raw vegetables ( too fibrous ) o wheat and raw grain breads o exotic lettuce ( iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water ) o greens ( turnip , mustard , kale , etc ... ) o little seeds , like sesame ( try getting an Arby's without it ! ) o long grain and wild rice ( husky ) o beans ( you'll generate enough gas alone without them ! ) o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing I was told that the more processed the food the better ! ( rather ironic in this day and age ) . The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible . I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged ( I only listed a few ) , to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt . If it's bad , don't do it again ! Remember though that this was while I was in remission . For Veggies : cook the daylights out of them . I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more thoroughly - you're mileage may vary . As with anything else , CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR . Don't just take my word . But this is the info I've been given , and it may be a starting point for discussion . Good luck ! - Spenser - - S .

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer ? I was just wondeing , since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist . A bone scan is a nuclear scan . Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer , and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body . The tracer is usually given intravenously . ( IV ) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein . After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body , the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer . The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it . As far as pain , the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line . What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer . This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer , since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system . I hope I have answered some of your questions . Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care . I'm a newly graduated nurse , and I enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before . My thoughts are with you both . Elisa B .

Crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 ( I have no reason to doubt him on this ) - does not like the book because 1 ) it makes too many unfounded claims , and 2 ) is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint . On the other hand , my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the " yeast connection " . But , I believe there is some truth to the book . Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction . In the meantime , I'd still encourage people who have " incurable " chronic sinus problems ( especially if they overused antibiotics ) , to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole ( along with liver panels before , during and after treatment just to play it safe ) . It is an empirical approach for sure , but when all else fails , and your ENT says " sorry , you'll just have to live with it " , it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence ( Dr . Ivker ) , supported by plausible theories ( outlined by Marty ) . At this stage you have little to lose , particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U . S . to be very minimal with relatively healthy ( i . e . , non-AIDS ) patients . I'm glad I did this , since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox ( itraconazole ) . Of course , your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not work for you . Talk to your doctor . Jon Noring - - Charter Member ---> > > INFJ Club .

I have a very deviated nasal septum ( probably the result at least partially from several fractures ) . One side has approximately 10-15 % of normal flow . Of course I have known this for years but recently discovered that I suffer from chronic sinus infection , discovered during an MRI after a severe migraine . A CT scan subsequently confirmed the problems in the sinuses . He wants to do endoscopic sinus surgery on the ethmoid , maxillary , frontal , and sphenoid , along with nasal septoplasty . He explained the procedure , and the risks . What I would like to know is if there is anyone out there who can tell me " I had this surgery , and it helped me " ? ( I've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it didn't really help them ) . I am a moderately severe asthmatic . ENT doc says large percentage see some relief of their asthma after sinus surgery . Also he said it is not unheard of that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved . I am 42 .

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate . But the vast majority are calcium - oxalate . Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle . I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine , always has been and probably always will be . If one uses conventional wisdom , there is a chance that you will be wrong . As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage , what's the big deal ( why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack ? ) . On the kidney stone problem . I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab . Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium . I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body . I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful ( I agree ) . If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals , I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine .

This is a lovely area for anecdotes , but I am sure you are on to something . As a physician , I almost never get sick : usually , when something horrendous is going around , I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case . When I do get really sick , it is always something unusual . This was not the situation when I was in medical school , particularly on pediatrics . I never had younger siblings myself , and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for . Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness , and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam ! I think what happens is that during training , and beyond , we are constantly exposed to new things , and we have the usual reactions to them , so that later on , when challenged with something , it is more likely a re-exposure for us , so we deal with it well and get a mild illness . I don't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way . Also , don't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home , and we carry a lot of that around . - kmFrom : koreth@spud.Hyperion.COM ( Steven Grimm ) Subject : Re : Opinions on Allergy ( Hay Fever ) shots ?

I post it , along with the other FAQ stuff . If you have questions , you want to send mail to Richard , not me . - - Dan Software Tools to help with RSI - - - This file describes tools , primarily software , to help prevent or manage RSI . This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches ... Please let me know if you know any other tools , or if you have information or opinions on these ones , and I will update this FAQ . I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them . Richard Donkin Internet mail : richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Tel : + 44 71 814 5708 ( direct ) Fax : + 44 71 251 2853 Changes in this version : Added information on StressFree , another typing management tool for Windows . TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS : these aim to help you manage your keyboard use , by warning you to take a break every so often . The better ones also include advice on exercises , posture and workstation setup . Some use sound hardware to warn of a break , others use beeps or screen messages . Often , RSI appears only after many years of typing , and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too : frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening . These tools act as an early warning system : by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises , you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is , getting RSI . Tool : At Your Service ( commercial software ) Available from : Bright Star Tel : +1 (206) 451 3697 Platforms : Mac ( System 6.0 . 4 ) , Windows Description : Provides calendar , keyboard watch , email watch , and system info . Warns when to take a break ( configurable ) . Has a few recommendations on posture , and exercises . Sound-oriented , will probably work best with sound card ( PC ) or with microphone ( Mac ) . Should be possible to record your own messages to warn of break . Tool : AudioPort ( sound card and software ) Available from : Media Vision Tel : +1 (510) 226 2563 Platforms : PC Description : A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port . Includes ' At Your Service ' . Tool : Computer Health Break ( commercial software ) Available from : Escape Ergonomics , Inc 1111 W . El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale , CA Tel : +1 (408) 730 8410 Platforms : DOS Description : Aimed at preventing RSI , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval , based on clock time , or after a set number of keystrokes - - whichever is earlier . It gives you 3 exercises to do each time , randomly selected from a set of 70 . Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do - data entry , word processing , information processing . Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does . CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it . Other information on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer . A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included . CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows , but does not then warn you when to take a break ; it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows . Cost : $ 79.95 ; quantity discounts , site licenses . Comments : The keystroke-counting approach looks good : it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time . The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers , as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools . Tool : EyerCise ( commercial software ) Available from : RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr . Haverhill , MA 01830 , US Tel : 800-451-4487 ( US only ) Platforms : Windows ( 3.0 / 3.1 ) , OS / 2 PM ( 1.3 / 2.0 ) [ Not DOS ] Description : Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval ( or at fixed times ) . Optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate . Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises , can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes . Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics . Quote from their literature : " EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises . The stretches work all parts of your body , relieving tension and helping to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury . The visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain . Together these help you to become more relaxed and productive . " " The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress _ by Edward C . Godnig , O . D . and John S . Hacunda , which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use . Cost : $ 69.95 including shipping and handling , quantity discounts for resellers . Free demo ( $ 5 outside US ) . Comments : I have a copy of this , and it works as advertised : I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management , because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes . Also , it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time , which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day . Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why . Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC , and has one window without window controls . Very usable though , and does not require any sound hardware . Tool : Lifeguard ( commercial software ) Available from : Visionary Software P . O . Box 69447 Portland , OR 97201 , US Tel : +1 (503) 246-6200 Platforms : Mac , DOS ( Windows version underway ) Description : Aimed at preventing RSI . Warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound . Includes a list of exercises to do during breaks , and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner . Price : $ 59 ; quantity discounts and site licenses . The DOS product is bought in from another company , apparently ; not sure how equivalent this is to the Mac version . The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine ( Feb 1991 ) . Good marketing stuff with useful 2 - page summaries of RSI problems and solutions , with references . Tool : StressFree ( commercial software , free usable demo ) Available from : LifeTime Software P . O .

Anon FTP : ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( and mirroring sites ) Platforms : Windows ( 3.0 / 3.1 ) ( Mac and DOS versions underway ) Description : Aimed at preventing RSI , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval ( or at fixed times ) . Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate . Quite a few exercises , can configure which ones are included to some extent . Online help . Version 2.0 is out soon , Mac and DOS versions will be based on this . Cost : $ 29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet , otherwise $ 39.95 . Site license for 3 or more copies is $ 20.00 each . ( NOTE : prices may have gone up for V2 . 0 ) . Comments : I have had a play with this , and it works OK . Its user interface design is much better in 2.0 , though still a bit unusual . expensive tool around and it does the job . It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo , so if you do get the demo , post it on your local bulletin boards , FTP servers and Bitnet servers ! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics , but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence , which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises . Tool : Typewatch ( freeware ) , version 3.8 ( October 1992 ) Available from : Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu :p ub / typing-injury / typewatch.shar Platforms : UNIX ( tested on SCO , SunOS , Mach ; character and X Window mode ) Description : This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing , based on how long you have been continuously typing . It does not provide exercises , but it does check that you really do take a break , and tells you when you can start typing again . Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today , each time it warns you , which is useful so you know how much you * really * type . It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out . The warning message appears on your screen ( in character mode ) , in a pop-up window ( for X Windows ) , or as a Zephyr message ( for those with Athena stuff ) . Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes , extra features and support for X , Zephyr and Mach . Not formally supported , but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk ( for SCO , SunOS , character mode ) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu ( for Mach , X Window mode , Zephyr ) if you have problems or want to give feedback . Tool : Various calendar / batch queue programs Available from : Various sources Platforms : Various Description : Any calendar / reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool . Or , any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen . Using Windows as an example : create a Calendar file , and include this filename in your WIN.INI ' s ' load = ' line so you get it on every startup of Windows . Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes , starting from 9 am . Press F7 ( Special Time ... ) to enter an appointment , enter 9:30 , hit Enter , and type some text in saying what the break is for . Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry , and repeat for the next appointment . By using Windows Recorder , you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a . REC file . Put this file on your ' run = ' line , as above , and you will then , with a single keypress , be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises . The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs . An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break ; this will depend a lot on your operating system . While these approaches are not ideal , they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool . If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch ( see above ) for your operating system , using batch jobs or whatever fits best . Tool : Digital watches with count-down timers Available from : Various sources , e . g . Casio BP - 100 . Description : Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes ; they usually reset easily to that number , either manually or automatically . While these are a very basic tool , they are very useful if you are writing , reading , driving , or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI . The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing . Comments : My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more , and still reading as much as ever , which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved . Getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day . I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer , but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period ! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS : these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout . One-handed typing tools may help , but be VERY careful about how you use them - - if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing , and may therefore make matters worse . Tool : hsh ( public domain ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu :p ub / typing-injury / hsh.shar Platforms : UNIX ( don't know which ones ) Description : Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings . Only works through tty's ( so , you can use it with a terminal or an xterm , but not most X programs ) . Tool : Dvorak keyboard tools ( various ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu :p ub / typing-injury / xdvorak . c Also built into Windows 3 . x . Description : The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use . It * may * help prevent RSI a bit , but you can also use it if you have RSI , since it will slow down your typing a * lot * :-) - - Dan Wallach " One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office # : 510-642-9585 of its cabinet .

The drug , which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone , protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection . The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy . It is more than 99 percent effective . " This drug presents another long-term , effective option for women to prevent pregnancy , " said FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler , M . D . " As an injectable , given once every three months , Depo Provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose . " Depo Provera is available in 150 mg . single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection . If a patient decides to become pregnant , she discontinues the injections . As with any such products , FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it . Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer , the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries . U . S . clinical trials , begun in 1963 , also found Depo Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive . The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain . In addition , some patients may experience headache , nervousness , abdominal pain , dizziness , weakness or fatigue . The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease , unexplained vaginal bleeding , breast cancer or blood clots in the legs , lungs or eyes . The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug , due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to osteoporosis . The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect . Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries . The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo , Mich . , which will market the drug under the name , Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection , first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s . At that time , animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer . Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer , including breast cancer in humans , to be minimal if any . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 15 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses P92 - 37 Food and Drug Administration Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177 The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life - threatening illnesses , such as AIDS , cancer and Alzheimer's disease . " These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible , " said HHS Secretary Louis W . Sullivan , M . D . " The effort to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration . " These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug based on " surrogate endpoints " or markers . They apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies . Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient . Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints - - such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease - - are used . The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness , based on surrogate endpoints , can be reasonably established . The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness . One new drug - - zalcitabine ( also called ddC ) - - was approved June 19 , using a model of this process , for treating the human immunodeficiency virus , HIV , the cause of AIDS . Accelerated approval can also be used , if necessary , when FDA determines that a drug , judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease , can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan . " The new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous FDA oversight , " said FDA commissioner David A . Kessler , M . D . " While drug approval will be accomplished faster , these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law . " HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 16 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the postmarketing studies do not verify the drug's clinical benefit , if there is new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective , or if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal of the drug or biologic . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 17 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 :: : Articles :: : Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing Blindness due to Retinal Disease National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests Baltimore , MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc . [ NASDAQ : REGN ] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye . The degeneration of these cells , known as photoreceptors , is a major cause of visual impairment This research , published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) , holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration - - currently , no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists . It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus , a hereditary disease that causes blindness . In addition , each year more than 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas . The research was funded in part by the RP ( Retinitis Pigmentosa ) Foundation Fighting Blindness , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye Institute . It was conducted by Drs . Matthew M . LaVail , Kazuhiko Unoki , Douglas Yasurnura , Michael T . Matthes and Roy H . Steinberg at UCSF , arld Dr . C ; eorge Yancoooulos , Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery . Regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from UCSF . In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances . Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week . Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells - - the rods and cones of the retina - - after light exposure . Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor ( CNTF ) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects ; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF - 1 ) were not effective in these experiments . Discussing the research , Dr . Jesse M . Cedarbaum , Regeneron's Director of Clinical Research , said , " BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age - related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision impairment , and for retinal detachment . Following detachment , permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 18 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells . It is possible that BDNF could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically . " " Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades . Vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness . It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life , " stated Jeanette S . Felix , Ph . D . , Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness . In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in conjunction with Aingen Inc . [ NASDAQ : AMGN ] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy , motor neuron diseases , Parkinson's disease , and Alzheimer's disease . By itself , Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease ) . Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals , Inc . , based in Tarrytown , New York , is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases , peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries , which affect more than seven million Americans . Drs . LaVail and Steinberg of UCSF are consultants to Regeneron . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 19 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease Research Resources Reporter written by Mary Weideman Nov / Dec 1992 National Institutes of Health High-fat , high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat . These findings , according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland , have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries . " This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels . It shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight , thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well , " explains principal investigator Dr . William E . Connor , head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University . Over the past 25 years Dr . Connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico , while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism . These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua . The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing . Probably as a result , coronary heart disease , which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations , is virtually non existent in their culture . Loosely translated , the name Tarahumara means " fleet of foot , " reflecting a tribal passion for betting on " kickball " races , in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball . The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans , tortillas , and pinole , a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water , together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables . The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game , fish , and eggs . Their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority ( 69 percent ) is of vegetable origin . Dietician Martha McMurry , a coinvestigator in the study , describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat . The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg / dL , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - cholesterol levels of 72 mg / dl , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) - cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg / dl . All of those values are in the good , low-risk range , according to the researchers . Elevated cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 20 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 disease . HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial . In previous studies the Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease , although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL - cholesterol . Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi . Food was weighed , cooked , and fed to the study participants under the investigators ' direct supervision , ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol . Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly , and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr . Connors laboratory for cholesterol , triglyceride , and lipoprotein analyses . Regular measurements included participant body weight , height , and triceps skin fold thickness . Thirteen Tarahumaras , five women and eight men , including one adolescent , were fed their native diet for 1 week , followed by 5 weeks of an " affluent " diet . " In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories . This is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat , sugar , and cholesterol , low in fiber , " elaborates Dr . Conners . Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index , or CSI , recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr . Connor . " The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet . CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level , particularly the LDL , " Dr . Connor explains . The Tarahumaran diet averages a very low CSI of 20 ; Dr . Connor's " affluent " diet used in the study ranks a CSI of 149 . The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels , typical of the native diet , before exposing subjects to the experimental diet . The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off , or plateau , for consumption of large amounts of fat . Changes in dietary fat and / or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels . " You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet . The Framingham study , for example , did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat . All subjects were already eating on a plateau , " Dr . Connor says . After 5 weeks of consuming the " affluent " diet , the subjects ' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent , primarily in the LDL fraction , which rose 39 percent . HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent , and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little . Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent , and subjects averaged an 8-p ound gain in weight . According to Dr . Connor , lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon , yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 21 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations . " We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study . In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption . In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories . We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol . HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat , and it increased quite a bit in this study , " Dr . Connor explains . Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol . HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat intake . Dr . Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat , less than 100 mg of cholesterol , and a CSI around 20 , varying in accordance with caloric needs . Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat , high in fiber . Dr . Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a " Mediterranean-style " diet . " The original Mediterranean diet , in its pristine state , consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products . We are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products . Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation . " The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development . Dr . Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite , who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen . " If the pattern of afluence increases , the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease , which places a termendous health care burden on a society . WHO would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease , so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being , rather than paying for unnecessary , expensive medical technology , " Dr . Connors says . " The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent , excessive diet . The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago , so a lot has been accomplished . We are changing rapidly , " he concludes .

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis , it does still occur in a good number ( 20 % ? ) and is something to keep in mind . Hepatitis C ( was : non-A , non-B Hep ) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis . There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis . Of course , cirrhosis is a most unkind disease . The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function . Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas , among many other problems , as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation . Less ominously , they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis . These effects include telangiactasias ( small red skin lesions ) and , in men , gynecomastia ( breast development ) . The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant . Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected , at least statistically , in your friend's case . Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor . Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you , and offer you support .

Not to drag this out anymore , but ... Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area , they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness , swollen joints , + / - fever . A recent paper ( March 1993 ) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting . This has been an ellusive matter for researchers , and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease . Up to now , only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to " prove " that the disease exists . This paper is noteworthy in two other regards : 1 ) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way . The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure . After this period , none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study . So these are proven , clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment . Of course , observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans . 2 ) The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine . Of course , they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy . Anyway , maybe we will see some independent , scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so . - - Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu> also : jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet AOL : JeffParke Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994 Pullman , WA 99164-7012From : geb@cs.pitt.edu ( Gordon Banks ) Subject : Re : Helium non-renewable ? ?

We are now mapping the human genome . We will ; then start to work on manipulation of that genome . Using genetic ; engineering , we will be able to insert whatever genes we want . ; No breeding , no " hybrids " , etc . The ethical question is , should ; we ? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1 ) reducing the gene pool and 2 ) defining the status of the eugenized . Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny . Then they may be able to crowd out " garbage genes . " This may in the future become possible . Even if it does , awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later . Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi * promoted * survival in some conditions . We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment . The reduced wilderness - and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind . Vulcanism , nuclear winter , ice age , meteor impact , new microbiological threats , famine , global warming , etc . , etc . , are all conceivable . Therefore , having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival . Of course , the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's . But if we could make " philosopher-kings " with great bodies and long lives , would we ( or they ) want to give them elevated status ? We could . The Romans did it with their kings * without * the benefits of such eugenics . The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused , but for a while , it was a problem . Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks . But there is nothing new under the sun . We treated slaves the same way for millennia before " 1984 . " I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems . Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time . That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet . Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change . However , also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power . The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others , and have survived by making better choices when their turns came . Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering . Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that , too . The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue . I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few . We , as eugenists , may make it , an we may not . If we don't , I hope there are reservoirs of " garbage " people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded " garbage " genes which will pull us through . I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same . Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has . Some men have , and I believe all men may , listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts . This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices . Peoples have died out for many reasons . The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves , and often others in the process . It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far , or else haven't had enough power for long enough . In summary , I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one . And the answer , in some ways hard , in some ways easy , is the same ancient answer . It isn't the power , it is the Spirit . Sorry for the long post . Got carried away .

No arguments about migranous aura ; in fact , current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal ( a la spreading depression of Leao ) rather than vascular ( something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia ) . Migraine without aura , however , is a fuzzier issue . There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function . The Copenhagen mafia ( Lauritzen , Olesen , et al ) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura , and ( unlike migraine with aura , but like tension-type ) they found no changes in LCBF . From one ( absurd ) perspective , * all * pain is neurologic , because in the absence of a nervous system , there would not be pain . From another ( tautologic ) perspective , any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it . Neurologists treat headache , therefore ( at least in the USA ) headache is neurologic . Whether neurologic or not , nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common . Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues , scrounging for cases , want all the headache patients they can get .

A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20 db down at 1000cps . Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80 dbs down from 1500cps on . This type of loss is difficult to fit . I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional , but leave a lot to be desired . Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks . These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed . I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound . Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them ' head to head ' with the Widex . Nevertheless , it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting . They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient ( presumably wealthy ) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago . The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids . I could take a trip to Europe on the difference ! Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money , I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds . I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite so expensive . - Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USAFrom : sdr@llnl.gov ( Dakota ) Subject : Re : HELP for Kidney Stones ...

One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery , but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children . So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain . This would be impossible without Naprosyn ( or something similar - but not aspirin , that doesn't work , and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago , so I'm through with it ) . In fact , Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain ( and pain in both legs ) as I'll discuss in a moment . Generally though , I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn , but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain ( it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain , it just takes quite a while ) . In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain . The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy . I've had MRIs , Xrays , CT scan , and EMGs ( I've had 2 of them , and don't intend to ever do that again ) with nerve conduction tests . The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain . The MRI reports both say I have several bulging , degeneratig disks , and from the Xrays ( and MRI , I think ) it is apparent that I have arthritis . The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations ( L3 - L4 , and L4 - L5 ) , but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations . The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG . Oh yeah , I had some other horrible test , called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the " internal nerves " are working fine . Anyway , the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain . The back pain is there all the time , but I can live with it . When the leg pain is there , I need some analgesic / anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work . So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months ( every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse , so I'd always resume ) . Since last November I have taken it much less frequently , and primarily for the pelvic pain . I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months ( 2-3 times a week ) . After the first month or so , my therapist put me on pelvic traction ( she had tried it earlier , but it had caused a lot of pain in my back , this time she tried it at a lower weight ) . After a month or two , the pain in my legs began going away ( but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back , which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage ) . So now , I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs , in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago . Getting back to my original reason for this post ... Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches , I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources , that " force " me to use them ( Oh , I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery , but I'm avoiding that too ) . I find the migraines difficult to deal with , occassionally I have to take off work , but usually I can work , but at a reduced capacity ( I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing ) . When the pelvic pain is bad , I can't concentrate much , I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes , because the pain is so bothersome . When the pain in my back is bad , it can cause severe burning in both legs , shooting pains in my legs , electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes , and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all . Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed . So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines , the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources . I get a lot of migraines , an average of 3 to 4 a month , which last 1-3 days . I've taken cafergot ( the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage ) , but I don't like the side effects ( if I take more than two I get diahrea ) . If I get a very bad headache , I will eventually take the cafergot . My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot , he said that when sumatriptan becomes available , I should try that . I've tried several other medications ( fiornal , midrin , fiornal with codeine , tegretol , and inderal ) but they either didn't work , or I couldn't tolerate them . So what can I do ? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain , which I agree with most of the time , but not when I have a lot of pain . I've had some bad experiences with surgery ( my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine ) , and I've already had surgery several times . Anyway , the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines , some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain . Janice RathmannSubject : Teenage acne From : pchurch@swell.actrix.gen.nz ( Pat Churchill ) My 14 - y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose . I bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment . I think that is probably enough , along with the usual good diet . However , he is on at me to get some product called Dalacin T , which used to be a doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the chemist's counter . I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T , or that Clearasil is OK . I had the odd spots as a teenager , nothing serious . His father was the same , so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring . But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance . I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment . I want to help - but with appropriate treatment . My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp . Sort of teenage cradle cap . Any pointers / advice on this ?

That's because these " peer-reviewed " studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people , they're looking at animal models .

You're being intellectually dishonest ( or just plain confused ) , because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other . Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants , but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods , nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects ( for obvious reasons . ) It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the " Chinese Restaurant Syndrome " .

Well , making a career out of it is a bit strong . I still believe that doing your own research is very , very necessary . I would not have progressed as much as I have today , unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done . And 5 years ago , it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me . So should I have stopped searching . Thank goodness I didn't . Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me . I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic . That you would go to one doctor , get a diagnosis , maybe get a second opinion , and then move on with your life . Just as an example ... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country , I have received 6 different diagnoses . These are the top names , the ones that people come to from all over the country . I have HAD to sort all of this out myself . Going to a support group ( and in fact , HEADING that support group ) was helpful for a while , but after a point , I found it very unproductive . It was much more productive to do library research , make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself . A recent movie , Lorenzo's Oil , offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about . If you haven't seen it , you should . It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying . Doctors are only human and can only do so much . But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed . I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown . If I had a broken arm , or a weak heart , or failing kidneys , I might not have the same opinion . That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments . With dizziness , you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it . I have chosen the latter .

All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved ( to me anyway ) that laetril was ineffective against cancer . A physician who continued to use it , when better , more effective , treatments are available , may deserve to be called a quack . Anti-fungals are in a different class . The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that * could * be due to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics ? Gorden Rubenfeld , through e-mail , has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with * good * bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body . I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice . He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection ( systemic ) is a real problem and just because he tries to keep * good * bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this . I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida . Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams . Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area , GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use . The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom . The arguement is that without proof , no action is warrented . Medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way . There has always been the use of conventional wisdom . A very good example is kidney stones . Conventional wisdom ( because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention ) , was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming . Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed . Through the recent New England J of Medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong , increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake . The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with * good * bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy . If it makes sense for livestock , why doesn't it make sense for humans David ? We are not talking about a dangerous treatment ( unless you consider yogurt dangerous ) . If this were a standard part of medical practice , as Gordon R . says it is , then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline . Marty B .From : lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu ( Lee Lady ) Subject : Re : Science and methodology ( was : Homeopathy ... tradition ? ) Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable . However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity . And in ordinary life , perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder . In the extreme case , a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house . In science , we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries . Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata - - - the search for scope and the search for certainty . If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today , because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense , since they lacked the concept of a limit . And in fact , because of the lack of a rigorous foundation , they made a number of errors in their use of calculus . It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz . Nonetheless , what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made .

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology . According to these posters " If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science . " Taken to the extreme , I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science . For one thing , an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism , where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing . ( I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology . Nonetheless , it is one of the results . ) And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results , I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment - - - and using less than perfect empirical methodology - - - will ever come with anything worthwhile . Furthermore , the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science : choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology ( or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them ) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance . For instance , certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative . ( One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology . In my opinion , a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods " avoid all known errors . " ) I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science . ( Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others . ) And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place . - - In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnetFrom : robg@citr.uq.oz.au ( Rob Geraghty ) Subject : Re : Good Grief !

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries , exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico ( 1 ) . This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital Discharge Survey ( NHDS ) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years . Data on discharges from short-stay , nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS , conducted by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics . For 1991 , medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals . The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean ( VBAC ) presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 ( 11 % ) women discharged after delivery . The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from national vital registration data . Therefore , estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the NHDS ( 2 ) . Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95 % confidence level , based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96 . In 1991 , there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries , the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 ( Table 1 ) . The primary cesarean rate ( i . e . , number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans ) for 1986-1991 also was stable , ranging from 16.8 to 17.5 . In 1991 , the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6 , significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher than the rates for the West ( 19.8 ) , Midwest ( 21.8 ) , and Northeast ( 22.6 ) . Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women ; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals ; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals ; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross / Blue Shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment ( Table 2 ) . The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries . Since the early 1970s , the number and percentage of births to older women increased ; however , if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 , the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 , essentially the same as the 23.5 observed . Based on the NHDS , of the approximately 4,111 , 000 live births in 1991 , an HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 estimated 966,000 ( 23.5 % ) were by cesarean delivery . Of these , an estimated 338,000 ( 35.0 % ) births were repeat cesareans , and 628,000 ( 65.0 % ) were primary cesareans . Since 1986 , approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually . In 1986 , 8.5 % of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally , compared with 24.2 % in 1991 . Of all cesareans in 1991 , 35.0 % were associated with a previous cesarean , 30.4 % with dystocia ( i . e . , failure of labor to progress ) , 11.7 % with breech presentation , 9.2 % with fetal distress , and 13.7 % with all other specified complications . The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days . In comparison , the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days , and for a repeat cesarean , 4.2 days - - nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries ( 2.2 days ) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs ( 2.3 days ) . In 1986 , the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days , for primary cesareans 5.2 days , for repeat cesareans 4.7 days , and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days , respectively . Reported by : Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems , National Center for Health Statistics , CDC . Editorial Note : The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 ; however , the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 ( 3 ) . Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth , a national health objective for the year 2000 ( 4 ) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries ( objective 14.8 ) . Postpartum complications - - including urinary tract and wound infections - - may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births ( 5 ) . Moreover , the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs . For example , in 1991 , the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $ 7826 and $ 4720 , respectively . The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $ 611 for physician fees and $ 2495 for hospital charges ( 6 ) . If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 ( the year 2000 objective ) instead of 23.5 , the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 ( 617,000 versus 966,000 ) , resulting in a savings of more than $ 1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges . Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 , several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery . For example , VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor , which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 ( 7 ) . Of women who are offered a trial of labor , 50 % - 70 % could deliver vaginally ( 7 ) - - a level already achieved by many hospitals (8 ) . Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46 % of hospitals surveyed in 1984 ( the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 national data are available ) ( 9 ) when the VBAC rate ( according to NHDS data ) was 5.7 % . The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35 % , based on all women who had a prior cesarean , regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted . To reach the overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate . One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery , by requiring a second opinion , and by instituting a peer-review process ( 10 ) . Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries ; public dissemination of physician - and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices ; and addressing malpractice concerns , which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery ( 4 ) .

Embassy Personnel - - Kampala , Uganda , 1992 = = = SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance . Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U . S . citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low , this risk varies substantially and unpredictably . During May 1992 , the Office of Medical Services , Department of State ( OMS / DOS ) , and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official U . S . personnel stationed in Kampala , Uganda . A review of the health records from the Embassy Health Unit ( EHU ) in Kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 . EHU , OMS / DOS , and CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among U . S . Embassy personnel . This report summarizes the results of the investigation . Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were available for review by OMS / DOS and CDC . A case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp . Of the 25 persons , 17 were slide - confirmed as having malaria . A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to obtain information about residence , activities , use of malaria chemoprophylaxis , and use of personal protection measures ( i . e . , using bednets and insect repellents , having window and door screens , and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening ) . Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey , 128 (8 2 % ) responded . Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala . Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years ( 6/32 19 % ) than among persons greater than 15 years ( 11/94 12 % ) , this difference was not significant ( relative risk RR = 1.6 ; 95 % confidence interval CI = 0.6- 4.0 ) . Eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years , compared with those living there less than 1 year . Travel outside of the Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria . Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey : mefloquine , chloroquine and proguanil , chloroquine alone , and proguanil alone . In addition , 23 ( 18 % ) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis . The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8 /8 8 9 % ) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis ( 9/37 24 % ) ( RR = 0.4 ; 95 % CI = 0.2- 0.9 ) . Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason . The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 5 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 all or most of the time ( 2/27 7 % ) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets ( 15/99 15 % ) ( RR = 0.5 ; 95 % CI = 0.1- 2.0 ) . The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening ( 0/16 ) , compared with those who rarely used repellent ( 17/110 15 % ) ( RR = 0 ; upper 95 % confidence limit = 1.2 ) . Risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening . As a result of this investigation , EHU staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens . EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel . Reported by : U . S . Embassy Health Unit , Kampala , Uganda ; Office of Medical Svcs , Dept of State , Washington , D . C . Malaria Br , Div of Parasitic Diseases , National Center for Infectious Diseases , CDC . Editorial Note : In Uganda , the increase in malaria among U . S . personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa . The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas - - preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas . Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum ; however , in some areas ( e . g . , Thailand ) , resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness . In Africa , the efficacy of mefloquine , compared with chloroquine alone , in preventing infection with P . falciparum is 92 % ( 1 ) . Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2 - year period . The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis ( e . g . , psychosis and convulsions ) is low ( i . e . , 1.3- 1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2 ) , while the risk for less severe adverse reactions ( e . g . , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , and sleep disturbances ) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics ( 1 ) . Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine , but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen ( 3,4 ) . Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance ( e . g . , Southeast Asia and Africa ) . In Africa , for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline , chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative , although less effective , regimen . Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum has not been reported .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 FDA Approval of Use of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine and a Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine for Infants and Children = = = SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate vaccines have been recommended for use in infants since 1990 , and their routine use in infant vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib disease in the United States ( 1-3 ) . Vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90 % reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these organisms . Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants , a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against these diseases : 1 ) the Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( tetanus toxoid conjugate , ActHIB Trademark ) , * for vaccination against Hib disease only and 2 ) a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) and Hib conjugate vaccine ( TETRAMUNE Trademark ) , a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and Hib disease . ActHIB Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine , polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate ( PRP-T ) , manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories , Inc . ( Swiftwater , Pennsylvania ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2 , 4 , and 6 months . Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart . Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose . A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children . Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster . More than 90 % of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark ( consecutive doses at 2 , 4 , and 6 months of age ) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug / mL ( 4 ) . This response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials . Two U . S . efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 8 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 for use in infants ( 4 ) . In these studies , no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T . These and other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed Hib vaccines . TETRAMUNE Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine . TETRAMUNE Trademark , available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals ( Pearl River , New York ) , combines two previously licensed products , DTP ( TRIIMMUNOL Registered , manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River , New York ) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( HibTITER Registered , manufactured by Praxis Biologics , Inc . Rochester , New York ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months - 5 years for protection against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and Hib disease when indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide . Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines , TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected to provide protection against Hib , as well as diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis , equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines . The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12 - 15 months ( 5 ) . The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 15-18 months of age , and a booster dose at 4-6 years ( 6-8 ) .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 10 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 :: : Dental News :: : International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection NIDR Research Digest written by Jody Dove March 1993 National Institute of Dental Research At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection , held January 31 - February 3 in San Francisco , participants explored issues related to the epidemiology , basic molecular virology , mucosal immunology , and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection . The workshop was organized by Dr . John Greenspan and Dr . Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology , School of Dentistry , University of California , San Francisco . An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance . The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries , including Asia , Africa , Europe , Central America , South America , as well as the United States and Canada . Support tor the workshop was provided by the National Institute of Dental Research , the National Cancer Institute , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , the NIH Office of AIDS Research , and the Procter and Gamble Company . Among the topics discussed were : the epidemiology of HIV lesions ; ethics , professional responsibility , and public policy ; occupational issues ; provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population ; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity ; opportunistic infections ; pediatric HIV infection ; and women's issues . Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV , to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions , to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations , to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions , and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions . Epidemiology Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago , the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 radically changed . In 1988 , HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males , intravenous drug users , and hemophiliacs . Today , more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents . While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa , a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well . Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time . Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis . They also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis . Social / political Issues Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use . Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients , and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is , and how it is acquired . Saliva and Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva , the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions . Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions , which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions . Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity . They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 ) aggregation / agglutination of HIV by saliva , which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell , and 2 ) direct effects on the virus or target cells . Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity . Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest . With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment , the life expectancy of HIV - infected children has tripled . The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases , particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth . Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 12 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection . Recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology , refinement of diagnostic markers , standardization of study design , and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy . Occupational and Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention . Factors under consideration include the cost / benefit of HIV testing , patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse , and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients . Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less .

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies . ] ... the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the 1950s . Using alternating currents of high frequency to ' illuminate ' their subjects , they photographed them . They found that if an object was a good conductor ( such as a metal ) the picture showed only its surface , while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically opaque . They found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living objects . Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to changes . The object's life activity was also visible in highly variable colour patterns . High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up seriously . Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and others have been produced in Brazil , Austria and Germany . Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's fingers , notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing someone . Normally , blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but , when a subject becomes angry or excited , the aura turns red and spotty . The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method . They argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person isn't actually ill but is about to be . They claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase . But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is the phantom effect . During high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut , the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up faintly . This is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can ' see ' the legs of amputees as if they were still there . The important thing about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon - - or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished . The energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object itself . [ ... ] Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally ' charged ' by a healer has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water ...

An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims , and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum . ] The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of study , making grand discoveries in his basement . Many paranormal movements can be traced back to such people - - Kirlian photography , for instance . If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks , common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a century . It took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura . In fact , Kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O . Pehek , Harry J . Kyler , and David L . Faust , who reported their findings in the October 15 , 1976 , issue of Science . Their conclusion : The variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious " auras " or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental state . Nevertheless , television shows , magazines , and books ( many by famous parapsychologists ) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of the unknown . - - Peter Kaminski kaminski@netcom.comFrom : jhl14@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu ( Jonathan H .

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression , or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed , but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression . Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both . Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present . I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output , but I would tend to doubt it . As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain , and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body . A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all . The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) on the level of circulating Thyroxin ( there are two types T3 and T4 - one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other - active - form in the liver ) . The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones ( estrogen , for example ) . Naturally , changing activity of the body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin , but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order . Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual ( a physician's reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-) and the Encyclopedia Brittanica ( should be available in your local library ) .

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation , he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist . All doctors are " qualified " to read x-rays , u / s , ct scans etc . it is just that a radiologist does nothing else , and thus , is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this ( skill in reading x-rays etc . just comes from plenty of practice ) . If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by this technique . - Paul . - - | Zikzak public access UNIX , Melbourne , Australia . | ^ ^ ^ | | | | | | / / / < O O > | # # # | / / /From : mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu ( Michael Covington ) Subject : Re : Twitching eyelid I'm surprised nobody mentioned that twitching of the eyelid can be a symptom of an infection , especially if it also itches or stings .

Surprise surprise , different people react differently to different things . One slightly off the subject case in point . My brother got stung by a bee . I know he is allergic to bee stings , but that his reaction is severe localized swelling , not anaphylactic shock . I could not convince the doctors of that , however , because that's not written in their little rule book .

What I tried to explain to Marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections - which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections . Marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists . Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this . At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining " good " anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group . I also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea ( that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora ) . However , it is NOT part of my routine practice to " reinnoculate " patients with " good " bacteria after antibiotics . I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients . Whether or not it is a " logical extension " from the available observations I'll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials . One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of C . difficile colitis ( NOT a fungal infection ) . There are case reports of using stool ( ie someone elses ) enemas to repopulate the patients flora . Don't try this at home . > not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams .

Marty , you've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms ( Noring syndrome ) to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis ( Elaine Palmer syndrome ) with systemic symptoms .

Unfortunately , the " Clinton Plan " , in whatever form it takes , will probably cost us an even greater sum . Bleah . SteveFrom : brown@spk.hp.com ( Pat R . Brown ) Subject : Re : HELP ... REFLUX ESOPHAGITIS Please post your results , a close friend has this condition and has asked these same questions .From : robin@ntmtv.com ( Robin Coutellier ) Subject : Critique of Pressure Point Massager As promised , below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog . I am very pleased with the results . The catalog description is as follows : The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a professional shiatsu masseur . The powerful motor drives two counter-rotating " thumbs " that move in one-inch orbits - - releasing tension in the neck , back , legs and arms . Pressure Point Massager A2623 $ 109 To order or receive a catalog , call ( 24 hours , 7 days ) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021 . * * * NOTE : When I ordered the massager , the item number was different , and the price was $ 179 , not $ 109 . When I received it , I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one . I was QUITE annoyed to see a $ 70 difference in price . I called them about it , and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers , although it looks and works exactly the same . He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one , using the price difference as a reason for return . In fact , since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory ( I received this one in 3 days ) , he told me I could use the one I already have until the new one arrives , then return the old one . VERY reasonable people . * * * I have long-term neck , shoulder and back pain ( if I were a building , I would be described as " structurally unsound :-) ) . I have stretches and exercises to do that help , but the problem never really goes away . If , for whatever reason , I do not exercise for a while ( illness , not enough time , lazy , etc . ) , the muscles become quite stiff and painful and , thus , more prone to further strain . Even with exercise , I sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track , which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p . t . The tension in my neck , if not released , eventually causes a headache ( sometimes confused with a sinus headache ) over my left eye . When my physical therapist has massaged my neck , and the sub-occipital muscles in particular ( the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull ) , the headache usually eased within a day , although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged . I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent - - a machine that would massage , NOT VIBRATE , my neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past , that I could use by myself . No doctor visit or inconvenient p . t . appts for a week later would be needed to use it . I could get up in the middle of the night and use it , if necessary . I have been using it for about a week or so now , and LOVE it . The base unit is about a 14 " x 9 " rectangle , about 3-3 / 4 " high , with handles on each side , and it plugs into an average outlet . The two metal " thumbs " are about 1-1 / 2 " in diameter and protrude about 2-1 / 2 " above the base . The thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable . They are located more toward one end , rather than centered ( see figure below ) . They move in either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions , depending on which side of the switch is pushed , and are very quiet . It can be used from either side . For instance , the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck , depending on which direction you approach it . ___ | __ ___ __ | | | | | | | | | | | | | \ ^ ^ / \ ^ ^ / | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ___ | | | | | | __ | | __ | | | ___ | For the neck / head , the user varies the amount of pressure used by ( if laying down ) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and / or neck to rest on the thumbs . The handles can also be used if sitting or standing , applying pressure with the arms / wrists . Since my wrists are also impaired ( I'm typing this over an extended period of time ) , and I don't have someone living with me who can apply it , laying down works well for me . For my back , I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair , position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged , and lean back lightly ( or not so lightly ) against it . The pressure of leaning back holds it in place . If I want to massage the entire spine , I simply move it down a few inches whenever I feel like it . For my back , this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used " home-made " massager of 2 tennis balls taped together ( with the balls , position ( against a wall or door ) them over the spine and move the body up and down against them ) . The tennis balls are better than nothing , but difficult to use for very long , especially if your quads are not in good shape , and my long hair gets ( painfully ) in the way if I don't pin it up first . As far as I'm concerned , the easier something like this is to use , the more likely I'll use / do it . If there are multiple considerations / hassles , I'm more likely to not bother with it . Not only has this machine helped with my headaches , but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased . The first time I used it on my neck / sub-occipital muscles , however , I overdid it and pressed too hard against it , which resulted in a very tender , almost bruised area for a few days . I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice , which helped . After that , I was more gradual about applying pressure . At this point , the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged . I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back , which is the most vulnerable point for me . It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades , although , again , it took a few days of massaging ( just a few minutes at a time ) to really work it out . I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems , although I cannot vouch for its durability ( it seems pretty sturdy ) , since I've had it such a short time . I plan to use it not only to ease tension , but also to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising ( and maybe after , too ) . I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks , so this was very timely for me . This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker . The catalog states they have been in business since 1976 . It contains quite a few health care products and , while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products , they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do . Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as " Dr . Leonards Health Care Catalog " or " Mature Wisdom " . I'm only 37 , but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists ( no big surprise here :-) ) . I consider many of those products to be rip-offs , particularly targeted toward the elderly , with dubious health benefits . I apologize for the length of this , but it's the kind of info _I_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail .

I first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago , and I have just got hold of a book , " How to improve your sight - simple daily drills in relaxation " , by Margaret D . Corbett , ( ' Authorized instructor of the Bates method ) , published in 1953 . It talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise . Has there been any study on whether this method actually works ? If it works , is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball , or by increasing the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too-long eyeball ? Since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation , seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process , i . e . , shorten it somehow ( preferably non-surgically ) . Has there been any recent studies on this ? Where can I find them ? I know RK works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball , but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better ( Bates's idea , right ? ) Thanks for any information .From : dpc47852@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ( Daniel Paul Checkman ) Subject : Re : Is MSG sensitivity superstition ? dyer@spdcc.com ( Steve Dyer ) writes : > In article <1qnns0$4l3@agate.berkeley.edu> spp@zabriskie.berkeley.edu ( Steve Pope ) writes : > > The mass of anectdotal evidence , combined with the lack of > > a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving > > the hypothesis , makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the > > most likely explanation for events . > You forgot the smiley-face . > I can't believe this is what they turn out at Berkeley .

Make a decision about whether you * really * want to be a medical doctor . I had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted . Medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself ; DON'T be pushed into it because of your parents / family / significant other . If you still want to be a medical doctor , determine how you can improve your application . A letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a ' big-shot ' famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face . Also , don't be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation ; give them a chance to say ' no , sorry ' instead of the medical school saying ' no , sorry ' . I have turned down writing recommendations for some students because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments , and some because I honestly could not recommend them at that point . Rewrite your personal statement ; take it by an English professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof-reading and get their criticism , both about what you are saying as well as how you say it . Review your academic accomplishments . If your grades are poor in some area , don't be afraid to spend some time in further coursework . Evidence of determined committment will help here . If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut courses , it usually shows . Look at your extracurricular involvements . Participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus ; substantial leadership roles in an organization help also .

Sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause pregnancy , even in the presence of a hymen . I doubt that sperm could make it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum , but it might be possible . So , it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant .

Be sure a dietician is up to date on Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis . Previously , low residue diets were recommended , but this advice has now changed . Also , there will be differences in advice in patients with and without obstructuon remaining , so input by the physician will be important .

The only good thing about nystatin is that it's ( relatively ) cheap and when taken orally , non-toxic . But oral nystatin is without any systemic effect , so unless it were given IV , it would be without any effect on your sinuses .

I hope some of you will find it as amusing as I did . ___ [ Reprinted w / o permission ] " There's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors ' salaries " By Mike Royko Tribune Media Services On a stupidity scale , a recent poll about doctors ' earnings is right up there . It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10 . It was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called Families USA . The poll tells us that the majority of Americans believe that doctors make too much money . The pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians . Those polled said , oh , about $ 80,000 a year would be OK . How generous . How sporting . How stupid . Why is this poll stupid ? Because it is based on resentment and envy , two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering . You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns $ 100,000- plus and get the same results . Since the majority of Americans don't make those bucks , they assume that those who do are stealing it from them . Maybe the Berlin Wall came down , but don't kid yourself . Karl Marx lives . It's also stupid because it didn't ask key questions , such as : Do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician ? If those polled said no , they didn't know , then they should have been disqualified . If they gave the wrong answers , they should have been dropped . What good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a doctor ? Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way : " How much should a person earn if he or she must ( a ) get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to ( b ) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math , physics , chemistry , and other lab work and maintain a 3.5 average or better , and ( c ) spend four more years of grinding study in medical school , with the third and fourth years in clinical training , working 80 to 100 hours a week , and ( d ) spend another year as a low-pay , hard-work intern , and ( e ) put in another three to 10 years of post-graduate training , depending on your specialty and ( f ) maybe wind up $ 100,000 in debt after medical school and ( g ) then work an average of 60 hours a week , with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or more until they retire or fall over ? " As you have probably guessed by now , I have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of Clinton and Clinton , and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake America's health care . Based on what doctors contribute to society , they are far more useful than the power-happy , ego-tripping , program-spewing , social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what Clinton's first budget is to frugality . But propaganda works . And , as the stupid poll indicates , many Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs . Of course doctors are well-compensated . They should be . Americans now live longer than ever . But who is responsible for our longevity--lawyers , Congress , or the guy flipping burgers in a McDonald's ? And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self-indulgent , lard-butted , TV-gaping couch cabbages . Ah , that is not something you heard President Clinton or Super Spouse talk about during the campaign or since . But instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain , they might have been more honest if they had said : " Let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have . That problem is you , my fellow American . Yes , you , eating too much and eating the wrong foods ; many of you guzzling too much hooch ; still puffing away at $ 2.50 a pack ; getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch ; doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world ; filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims ; engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure . " You and your habits , not the doctors , are the single biggest health problem in this country . If anything , it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do . " In fact , I don't understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day . " So as your president , I call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly . Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy - greasy with double fries . Do as I say , not as I do . " But for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid , there is another solution : Don't use them . That's right . You don't feel well ? Then try one of those spine poppers , needle twirlers , or have Rev . Bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit . Or there is the do-it-yourself approach . You have chest pains ? Then sit in front of a mirror , make a slit here , a slit there , and pop in a couple of valves . You're going to have a kid ? Why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have ( while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn ) ? Just have the kid the old-fashioned way . Squat and do it . And if it survives , you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots . By the way , has anyone ever done a poll on how much pollsters should earn ? Royko is a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for Tribune Media Services . ___ - - * * * Vinay J .

One of the most important ( and difficult ) aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context , scope , and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim .

I do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections . I can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms , while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms .

I don't understand the assumption that because something is found to be carcinogenic that " it would not be legal in the U . S . " . I think that naturally occuring substances ( excluding " controlled " substances ) are pretty much unregulated in terms of their use as food , food additives or other " consumption " . It's only when the chemists concoct ( sp ? ) an ingredient that it falls under FDA regulations . Otherwise , if they really looked closely they would find a reason to ban almost everything . How in the world do you suppose it's legal to " consume " tobacco products ( which probably SHOULD be banned ) ? Dave Allen Space Science & Engr . Ctr .

I saw this a few years ago on " Tomorrow's World " ( low-brow BBC technology news program ) . The patient is lowered into a bath of de-ionized water and carefully positioned . High intensity pressure waves are generated by an electric spark in the water ( you don't get electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct ) . These waves are focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to break up . This is completely painless .

The acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this OTC medication . A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity , and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis . If I recall correctly , the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine , which is a highly reactive intermediate , which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione . When hepatic glutathione is used up , this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis . The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay ( 2-4 days ) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage . This is NOT a nice way to die . As to taking 20-30 of these tablets , that comes to 5-7 . 5 grams of acetaminophen . In a normal adult , this would probably cause nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and loss of appetite .

There will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads . The whole thing will then be published on CD-ROM with video and sound clips for added richness . I am looking for a CD-ROM publisher as well . The text part may also be available on the CANARIE electronic highway being developed in Canada as well . I am still looking for a publisher though Penguin Canada came close to being it . Hope to find one soon . I would like to again ask for more nominations , especially in the pure sciences of Physics , Chemistry and Biology . Also criticisms of the list are welcomed .

But colonic flushes are not the way to improve gut function . Each person has almost a unique mix of bacteria in his / her gut . Diet affects this mix as does the use of antibiotics . A diet change is a much better way to alter the players in your gut than is colonic flushes . Cross contamination has been a real problem in some of the outfits that do this " treatment " since the equipment is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient " treatments " . Dental drills have me a little concerned about HIV infection and I've picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his instruments ( more clostly but much safer ) . Full sterile technique is also used just like that practiced in an OR ( mask , gloves and gowns worn and disposed of between patients ) . Each visit costs me 15 dollars more than the standard and customary fee so I have to pay it out of pocket . His much higher fees do not drive away patients . I can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to this colonic flush procedure . For very little , if any benefit , you subject yourself to hepatitis , cholera , parasitic disease and even HIV . Just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment ? Could they be having GI distress ? Could this distress be due to a pathogenic organism ? Could I get this organism if the equipment is not cleaned properly between patients ?

And has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by Robert Scott Root - Bernstein . See his book , " Discovering " . Ring structures for benzene had been proposed before Kekule ' , after him , and at the same time as him . The current models do not resemble Kekule's . Many of the predecessors of Kekule's structure resemble the modern model more . I don't think " extra-scientific " is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science , except as a proposed definiens . Extra-rational is a better phrase . In fact , there are quite a number of well-known cases of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction . For example , Pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers ( the origin of stereochemistry ) partly because he liked a friend's crank theory of chemical action . The friend was wrong , but Pasteur's discovery stood . A prior investigator ( Mitscherlich ) , looking at the same phenomenon , had missed a crucial detail ; presumably because he lacked Pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric ( now we say : d-tartaric ) acid . Again , Pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers ( tartaric acid again ) not because of some rational conviction , but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid . His notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the " Newton of mirror-image life , " which he never admitted publically . Perhaps the best example is the discovery that DNA carries genes . Avery started this work because of one of his students , and ardent Anglophile and Francophobe Canadian , defended Fred Griffiths ' discoveries in mice . Most of Griffiths ' critics were French , which decided the issue for the student . Avery told him to replicate Griffiths ' work in vitro , which the student eventually did , whereupon Avery was convinced and started the research program which , in 15 or so years , produced the famous discovery ( Avery , MacLeod , and McCarty , JEM 1944 ) . - - Mark A .

Burzynski's work is not too promising . None of his A - 1 through A - 5 antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer . The NCI conducted tests of A - 2 and A - 5 against leukemia in mice , with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it . ( These were in 1983 and 1985 ) Burzynski claims that A - 10 is the active factor common to all of A - 1 and A - 5 ( something which he has not shown , A - 10 has only been extracted from A - 2 . He also hasn't shown that A - 1 through A - 5 are actually distinct substances ) . The NCI conducted a series of tests using A - 10 against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes : leukemia , non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer , colon cancer , cancer of the central nervous system , melanoma , ovarian cancer and renal cancer . A - 10 exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested . It is necessary to process A - 10 since it is not soluble ( Burzynski's theory requires soluble agents ) , but this basically hydrolizes it to PAG ( which he calls AS 2.5 ) . PAG is not an information carrying peptide , something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity . AS 2.1 ( also derived from A - 10 ) is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG . PA ( also not a peptide ) can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about $ 0.09 a gram . A - 10 is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide , both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy . The nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known . In spite of this similarity , A - 10 does not appear to have been tested for it's potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy . Many of Burzynski's statements about the origin of his theory , early research , past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue . sdb - - - sdb@ssr.comFrom : jfare@53iss6.Waterloo.NCR.COM ( Jim Fare ) Subject : Re : Endometriosis In article <1993Apr16.032251.6606@rock.concert.net> naomi@rock.concert.net ( Naomi T Courter ) writes : > can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis ? i heard > it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names > ... > - - Naomi Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist outside the uteris . Sometimes this causes problems , often it doesn't . There is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are causing other problems . One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary . This caused her a _great_ deal of pain . Another lady I know has an endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall ; she is not having it removed .

If I had to choose , I'd much > rather have the persistant type . Being a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything . Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical , biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular carcinoma . Most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis ( CPH ) are probably the result of a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined . The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy . It consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis . But in contrast to chronic active hepatitis ( CAH ) there is no periportal inflammation , bridging necrosis , or fibrosis . CPH has , indeed , an excellent prognosis . If I had to choose between CAH and CPH there is no question I would also choose CPH . However , as David pointed out , the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it . The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal , with biopsies showing areas compatible with both CPH and CAH . Maybe it is a sampling problem . Maybe it is a continuum .

The current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food . There is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors . There is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on IV nutrition . But I digress .

Would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems . The digestive processing idea is changing , but if a food causes problems , avoid them . Be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause . Crohn's commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize . There was a good article in the CCFA newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber . It would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in Crohn's .

Yes , there is such a thing as eye dominance , although I am not sure if this dominance refers to perscription strength . As i recall , if you selectively close your dominant eye , you will percieve that the image shifts . This will not happen if you close your other eye .

What would this effect be called ? Have these effects > ever been studied ? How common are these effects ? Thank you in > advance for all replies . These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments . Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are " blind " in various ways . Some of these are : o The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a placebo or the test treatment , i . e . , whether they are in the control group or the test group . o Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment . o Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment . Obviously , at the point at which the data is analyzed , one has to differentiate the test group from the control group . But the analysis is quasi-public : the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it . It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals , such as mice , there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not " blind " themselves . It is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are , though it is important that in all respects except the one tested , the control and test groups are treated alike .

This is a definite temptation . Harumph . Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something to aspire to . :-) I can't really argue with your logic , though I think you may be extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of one . Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true , it is not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who treat Lyme disease . By your logic , I could conclude that all of the physicians who consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to Lyme patients are doing it for the money , rather than because they believe they are encouraging good medicine . I have no idea how sincere these guys are , but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment .

What causes it ? Could it be caused by a > nervous breakdown ? > Obesssive Compulsive Disorder ( not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive _Personality_ Disorder ! ) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions ( persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained ) , or compulsions ( repetitive , ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted ) . OCD is often associated with certain forms of depression . Examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one ( though not accompanied by anger ) , or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts . Generally , the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities . The individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind , rather than being from an external source . Examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing , or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety . In OCD , the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual , take an hour or more per day , and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships . Treatments include psychotherapy , behavioral methods , and sometimes certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions . The standard diagnostic code for OCD , if you want to look it up in the DSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 . kind regards , todd + - - - + | Todd I .

I was in my 18th hour of labor , had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was exhausted . My OB and I decided to go for a csec . The OB called in the anesthisiologist ( sp ? ) and asked him to help prep me for surgery . AFTER , watching me go through a couple contractions , the anes ( or anus as I like to refer to him ) said , " Well , I am off duty now . " ( still staring between my legs at that ) . The OB asked to go call whomever it was who was on duty and ask him / her how long it would take ... and if it was going to take more than a few minutes , to please stay even though he was off duty . The anes . went out , supposedly to call the on-call anes . In a couple of minutes the nurse came running in to tell the OB that the anes . had left without even trying to get ahold of the on-call . It was the only time during my labor that I swore . The on-call anes . took 20 minutes to get there . Come to find out , the anes . had only just gone off duty ( about 2 minutes before ) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the next on-call got there . Good thing for all of us ( especially him ) that it was not a critical emergency . But boy would I love to knock that fellow's ouchie places ... just to let him be in pain a few little minutes .

DeanthaFrom : joel@cray.com ( Joel Broude ) Subject : Mevicore vs . Lopid vs . ? I used to be on lopid . It did a good job of reducing cholesterol ( 295 down to around 214 ) , as well as LDL and triglycerides . Then , I got pneumonia , and for some reason , the Lopid stopped working very well ; cholesterol and triglycerides soared . The levels might have stabilized over time , but a new doctor had me quit , wait a month , then switch to Mevicore . On Mevicore , my total cholesterol was down to 207 , LDL was 108 , and HDL was 35 ; but the trig's were still very high , around 318 , and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal , SGOT = 83 ( N = 1-35 ) , GGTP ( ? hard to read copy ) = 42 ( N = 0 - 35 ) . He said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern , and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures . He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal ( " Just to be extra cautious , though I'm sure it's not a problem . " ) , and wants me to go back on it after that . I suggested maybe Lopid might be the better choice , and he said that he wouldn't object if that's what I want to do . But Lopid has one particular side effect I'm not fond of . Should the above liver and trig figures be feared ? What happens to folks with high trig levels ? Is my liver in danger with the above results ? Would I be better off on Lopid , despite its inconvenient side effect , or , perhaps , some other drug ?

But - - like chiropracty - - there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme , invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique .

He recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing ( including saliva ) . The doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition which he called " Barrett's Syndrome " .

WFL - - Walter LundbyFrom : sharon@world.std.com ( Sharon M Gartenberg ) Subject : From Srebrenica : " Doctoring " in Hell SREBRENICA'S DOCTOR RECOUNTS TOWN'S LIVING HELL By Laura Pitter TUZLA , Bosnia , Reuter - Neret Mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged Muslim town of Srebrenica last August . But after treating 4,000 mangled victims of Bosnia's bloody war , he considers himself a surgeon . ` ` Now I'm a surgeon with great experience although I have no license to practice . But if I operate on a person and he lives normally that's the greatest license a surgeon could have . ' ' Evacuated by the U . N . this week to his home town of Tuzla , the Muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year-long Serb siege of Srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there . ` ` I lived through hell together with the people of Srebrenica . All those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce , ' ' he told reporters . Mujanovic , 31 , had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in Tuzla , but before going to Srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own . Now he says he has performed major surgery 1,396 times , relying on books for guidance , amputating arms and legs 150 times , usually without anesthetic , delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections . He worked 18 - to - 19 - hour days , slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last Aug . 5 and treated 4,000 patients . He arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from Tuzla , 60 miles northwest of Srebrenica . About 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain , he said . His worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven Serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field , killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102 . Half of the dead were women and children . The people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer . ` ` There was no warning ... the blood flowed like a river in the street , ' ' he said . ` ` There were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together . One woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead . They had no heads . ' ' Before Mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable , he said . Many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools , facilities and medicine . The six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did . ` ` They didn't know the basic principles for amputating limbs . ' ' Once he arrived the situation improved , he said , but by mid-September he had run out of supplies . ` ` Bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes they were falling apart in my hands , ' ' he said . Doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding . ` ` People were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations , ' ' he said . Blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types . ` ` I felt destroyed psychologically , ' ' Mujanovic said . The situation improved after Dec . 4 , when a convoy arrived from the Belgian medical group Medecins Sans Frontieres . But Mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid-December after Bosnian Serbs began a major offensive in the region . ` ` Every day we had air strikes and shellings . ' ' Then the hunger set in . Between mid-December and mid-March , when U . S . planes began air dropping food , between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition , he said . ` ` I know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation , ' ' he said . According to Mujanovic , around 5,000 people died in Srebrenica , 1,000 of them children , during a year of siege . Mujanovic plans to return to Srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife , who is ill in Tuzla . ` ` They say I'm a hero , ' ' he said . ` ` There were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road , crying and waving when I left . And I cried too . ' ' - - Sharon Machlis Gartenberg Framingham , MA USA e-mail : sharon@world.std.comFrom : samuel@paul.rutgers.edu ( Empress Carrena Kristina I ) Subject : REQUEST : FAQ Hi .

My brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome . Also called steroid resistant Sweet's syndrome . This syndrome started after she had had Iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism . She'd been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it . I understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist . Her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital . She entered the hospital because of the Sweet's syndrome symptoms ( skin lesions ) . I've looked through the last two years of Medline and didn't find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and Sweets . . I checked a handbook which said that Sweet's was associated with leukemia . I'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in New York City or who travel to New York City . For the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology . Any information that might help .

L . acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free . Most of the commercial yogurt sold in the U . S . has a very low L . acidophilus and L . bulgaricus count . Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem . Gordon R . has told me through e-mail that he gives his patients L . acidophilus and several different obligate anaerobes ( which set-up shop in the colon ) but he hasn't told me which ones yet . The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a chance ( mouth , anus , sinus cavity and vagina ) . Having these good bacteria around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal region or the vagina . I have not proposed a systemic action for candida blooms . I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from the evil yeast blooms in the body . I'm not ready to buy that yet . I do believe that complications at specific sites ( vagina , anal and maybe lower colon , sinus and mouth ) can result from antibiotic use which removes the competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked . Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way ( in my opinion ) to get rid of the problem . Anti-fungals , a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the pH to basically starve the candida out .

Well , maybe I'm getting picky , but I always thought that a yeast was one form that a fungus could exist in , the other being the mold form . Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds , depending on environment .

Check out #27903 , just some 20 posts before your own . Maybe you missed it amidst the flurry of responses ? Yet again , the use of this newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters they have substantial knowledge of . For cites on MSG , look up almost anything by John W . Olney , a toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on development . It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an excitotoxic food additive , and that its major constituent , glutamate is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain ( humans included ) . Too much in the diet , and the system gets thrown off . Glutamate and aspartate , also an excitotoxin are necessary in small amounts , and are freely available in many foods , but the amounts added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be encountered in a ny single food . By eating lots of junk food , packaged soups , and diet soft drinks , it is possible to jack your blood levels so high , that anyone with a sensitivity to these compounds will suffer numerous * real * physi 9logical effects .

In fact Adiposity 101 mentions a similar study ( search for " life events " in any recent version of Adiposity 101 ) . The problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused the weight gain in the first place . This is critical because someone who gains weight because of something temporary ( drug effect , life event , etc . ) may appear successful at dieting when the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary condition that caused the weight gain . - - Chuck Forsberg WA7KGX ... ! tektronix ! reed ! omen ! caf Author of YMODEM , ZMODEM , Professional-YAM , ZCOMM , and DSZ Omen Technology Inc " The High Reliability Software " 17505 - V NW Sauvie IS RD Portland OR 97231 503-621-3406From : battin@cyclops.iucf.indiana.edu ( Laurence Gene Battin ) Subject : Re : Krillean Photography In article <1993Apr26.204319.11231@ultb.isc.rit.edu> , E .

This indicates confusion between " proof " and the process > of doing science . You are making precisely one of the points I wanted to make . I fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the * process * of science and the end result . As an end result of science , one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable . But there is nothing objective about the * process * of science . If good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies , this would certainly be valuable information . But it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science . This is where you and I disagree with Turpin . In order to have science , one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense , not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses . Experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science , but they are merely the culmination of scientific research . The most important part of true scientific methodology is SCIENTIFIC THINKING . Without this , one does not have any hypotheses worth testing . ( No , hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data . Nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you're shaving or looking out the window . At least not unless you've done a lot of really good thinking beforehand . ) The difference between a Nobel Prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology . It depends on the quality of their THINKING . It really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies . And it bothers me even more that there are many fields , such as certain parts of psychology , where there seems to be no thinking at all , but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses . And I'm especially offended by Russell Turpin's repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes . Simply avoiding mistakes doesn't get you anywhere . - - In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnetFrom : sjha+@cs.cmu.edu ( Somesh Jha ) Subject : What is " intersection syndrome " near the forearm / wrist ?

Candida can do that to you . :-) Gordon , I think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms L . Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L . acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen ( just like it does in the vagina ) . As much stuff as there is in the lay press about L . acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections , I'm really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out . The calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window . Where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials ? The clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene ( and a very important one ) . The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out-of-hand , especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely ( like it is in animal husbandry ) .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four , said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases . Part of that emphasis includes a new series titled " Emerging Infectious Diseases " to be featured in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report , which has a wide circulation in the health community . The issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific counselors to update the CDC's draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments . " This is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it , " said Dr . Ruth Berkelman , deputy director of the CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases . There were more cases of malaria in the U . S . in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s , and Latin America is experiencing a cholera epidemic , the first in this century , she said . Resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem . " We are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past " Berkleman said . She said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment . " Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem , infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the United States , " the CDC said . It cited the emergence since the 1970s of a " myriad " of newly identified pathogens and syndromes , such as Escherichia coli O157 : H7 , a deadly bacterial infection ; the hepatitis C virus ; HIV , the virus that causes AIDS ; Legionnaires disease ; Lyme disease ; and toxic shock syndrome . " The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control , such as cholera , malaria and tuberculosis , have increased in many areas , " the CDC said . It said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance . = = = * = = = SOURCE : WALL STREET JOURNAL REFERENCE : 04/15 / 93 , pB1 HEADLINE : Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues The tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage : legal liability . A federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease , a flu-like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death . The decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property . The decision by U . S . District Judge Robert J . Ward in New York came after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the Long Island Railroad . Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job . He ordered the New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than $ 560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering , in addition to medical expenses and lost wages . Summer camps , schools , companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas , and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling , says Stephen L . Kass , an attorney at New York law firm Berle , Kass & Case , who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability . Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable . Lawsuits for insect bites , while rare , aren't unheard-of . A summer vacationer in Southampton , N . Y . , last year sued the owner of the home she rented , claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky Mountain spotted fever . In 1988 , also on Long Island , a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $ 3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee , causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia . The judge later threw out the award , citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant . But lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the country - - it's most prevalent in New England , the Middle Atlantic states , Wisconsin , Minnesota and the Northwest - - may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one . The illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease . Lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to Lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years . Payments in worker's-compensation cases , however , are limited to medical costs and lost earnings . The case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages , because it involved the question of negligence . Unlike the worker's compensation process , the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and , as a result , for additional payments for pain and suffering . Property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease . Ira M . Maurer , a partner at New York law firm Elkind , Flynn & Maurer , who represented the rail workers , says the decision will help to establish " the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against Lyme disease . " Lawyers caution that despite Judge Ward's decision , winning a lawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult . For one thing , victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite . Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad , even though none of the men remembered being bitten . The workers , who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects , said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites . A spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal . The railroad also disputes Judge Ward's finding that it didn't do enough to protect employees . The spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites . Debate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners , such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness . Earlier this week , the Journal of the American Medical Association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease . And damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes . Because of health and safety concerns , some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against Lyme disease . Last year , at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes , N . J . , Becton , Dickinson & Co . began using Damminix , a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc . of Boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease . The medical - supply company's headquarters include a 120 - acre park , and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected . Ruth Lister , a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in Indianapolis , says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks . And Carole Katz , a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners Association , says her group spends $ 30,000 each year to treat their 100 - acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing pesticide . = = = * = = = TITLE : Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease . AUTHORS : Chancellor MB ; McGinnis DE ; Shenot PJ ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH , Department of Urology , Jefferson Medical College , Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . REFERENCE : J Urol 1993 Jan ; 149 ( 1 ): 26-30 Lyme disease , which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , is associated with a variety of neurological sequelae . We describe 7 patients with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction . Urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and detrusor areflexia in 2 . Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not noted on electromyography in any patient . We observed that the urinary tract may be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme disease : 1 ) voiding dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2 ) the spirochete may directly invade the urinary tract . In 1 patient bladder infection by the Lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy . Neurological and urological symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was protracted . Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological deficits were common . Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme disease need to be aware of B . burgdorferi infection in the differential diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction . Conservative bladder management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic evaluation is recommended .

Flights of fancy , and other irrational approaches , are common . The crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies ; they aren't of any use unless they make you do some experiments . I've known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work ; usually they won't admit out loud what the fantasy was , prior to the consumption of a few beers .

He got very excited , hoping that he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes . This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays . The result was a well-conserved , 400 or so bp , sequence that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome . Unfortunately for Warren's fantasy , it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome . On the other hand , the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated ; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized ; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created . Other species have different sets of transposons . Fortunately for me , Warren and I used to eat dinner at T . G . I . Fridays all the time . ) > It further at least implicitly advances the position that > sciences goes " forward " ( and it is not clear what this means given the > context in which it occurs ) by generating in a completely non-rational > and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then > weeded out via the " critical function " of science . I'm not sure that it's random . But there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses . If you are really working in an unknown area , it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true ; under those circumstances , the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have . If they are wrong , you will find out soon enough ; but at least , you will find out _something_ . If you try to do experiments at random , with no prior conceptions at all in mind , you will probably get nowhere . > ( Though why this critical > function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery . Unfortunately , the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non-rational forces . Then we get varieties of pathological science : Lysenko , Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene , cold fusion , and so forth . > If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are > subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true > of the application of any " critical function " concerning replication . > This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an " anything goes " view . ) I don't agree that this follows . In fact , this is _exactly_ the point at which I disagree with Feyerabend . It is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing process . Failures there are aplenty , but , on the whole , things work out . Another point : there are a couple of senses of the phrase ` ` experimental design ' ' . I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_ , not design . Alexander Fleming ( Proc . Royal Soc . , 1922 ) chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons ( Phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea ; Fleming probably thought runny bottom , runny nose , what the hell , it's worth a try . ) but his method of looking for phage was well-designed to detect anything phage-like ; in fact , he found lysozyme . > True , the generation part * can * be totally irrational .

Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have > resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply > do not generalize well to the actual history of science . It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs . irrational . Perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons , or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds . The main examples I can think of are from modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole . - - Mark A .

Both courses , Intensive Elementary Japanese and Intensive Intermediate Japanese , are ten week , ten credit courses each equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study . They begin June 7 and end August 13 . The courses meet five days per week , five hours per day . There is a flat rate tuition charge of $ 1600 per course . Fellowships available for science and engineering students . Contact Steven Brener , Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology Management Program , at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or address below . ALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY , THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS . # # # # # # New Program Announcement # # # # # # JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM The Japanese Science and Technology Management Program ( JSTMP ) is a new program jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon University . Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific communitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and January 1994 . PROGRAM OBJECTIVES The program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the United States . It is also designed to let scientists , engineers , and managers experience how the Japanese proceed with technological development . This is facilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and laboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop long-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts . PROGRAM DESIGN To fulfill the objectives of the program , participants will be required to develop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and its culture . Correspondingly , JSTMP consists of three major components : 1 . TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE Several Japanese language courses will be offered , including intensive courses designed to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a relatively short time . 2 . EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE A particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the cultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in manufacturing and information technology . Courses will be available in a variety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology , Sociology , History , and Political Science . Moreover , seminars and colloquiums will be conducted . Further , a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or research facilities in the United States will be scheduled . 3 . AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN Upon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU , participants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe , and participate in the management of technology . Internships in Japan will generally run for one year ; however , shorter ones are possible .

I would appreciate any comments about this and other ' new ' technology for hearing aids . The ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT & T and appears to take a different approach from other aids . It appears to me that a new ' programmable ' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible ( and programmable ) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in ' noisy ' situations . The major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies ( splitting point is programmable ) , apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies , while the important consonant information ( unfortunately for me ) is in the high frequencies . The two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable . They have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call ' abnormal growth of loudness ' . This latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience , though I think the phrase is missleading . What appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss , the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the ' too loud ' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge . This means that if you just boost all sound levels , you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses . Hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point . You want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum ( specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff ) . Aids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor ' compress ' useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components .

I think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising . That's not what I'd quibble about . What I'd like to know are Toricelli's reasons for doing his experiment ; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons , but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem . It may be impossible to know much about Toricelli's thoughts ; that's too bad if it is so . One of Root-Bernstein's services to science is that he has gone rooting about in Pasteur's and Fleming's ( and other people's ) notes , and has discovered some surprising clues about their motivations . Pasteur never publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life , but the dreams are right there in his notebooks ( finally public after many years ) , ready for anyone to read . And I and my friends often have the most ridiculous reasons for pursuing results ; one of my best came because I was mad at a colleague for a poorly-written claim ( I disproved the claim ) . Of course , Toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety : where the fantasy not only motivates the experiment , but turns out to be right in the end . Mark - - Mark A .

I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney stone posts . Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet , as is heart disease and cancer . When I give dietary advise , it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group ( or Sci . Med . Nutrition where I do most of my posting ) to avoid seeing a doctor . Nothing can be further from the truth . Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out . But once it is , diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance . Same thing with heart disease and cancer , if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases , don't use what I'm going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor . You have to go . Hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program ( but the odds are that you will not and that's why I'm here ) . When my wife detected a lump in here breast I didn't say , don't worry my vitamin E will take care of it . Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician , plan and simple . If it's begnin ( which most are ) fine , then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring . But let me tell you right now , if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns , get your butt into the doctor's office as fast as your little feet can carry you ( better yet , have a mammography done on a regular basis , my wife kept putting her's off , both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done ) . Her gynocologist even scheduled one , but she didn't show up ( too busy running the Operating Room for the biggest Hospital in Tulsa ) . One more thing , I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist . This group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease . There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body . But you talk about flying blind , man this is really blind treatment . No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used . I'm not saying that some of this stuff couldn't be right on the money , it may well be . But my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of Weinsier and Morgan , the two M . D's who wrote the new Clinical Nutrition textbook . My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress . That's where I'm coming from folks . Blast away if you want , I'm not going to change . Put me in your killfile if you want , I really don't care . I'm averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think that I've got something important to say . But I'm also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind . That's life . Chromium is one of the trace elements . It has a very limited ( but very important ) role in the body . It is used to form glucose tolerance factor ( GTF ) . GTF is made up of chromium , nicinamide ( niacin ) , glycine , cysteine and glutamic . Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form GTF . Some foods already have GTF ( Liver , brewers or nutritional yeast , and black pepper ) . When chromium is in GTF , a pretty good absorption is seen ( about 20 % ) . But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate ( chromium picolinate ) it's absorption is much lower ( 1 to 2 % , lowest for all the minerals ) . I've been posting in Misc . Fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a " fat burner " . Chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm . I wouldn't do it though . The adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day . The average American is getting about 30ug per day from his / her diet . Chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency . I can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in Type II diabetes but I'm not going to because for each positive one , there also seems to be a negative one as well . I'm convinced that the problem is bioavailability . When yeast ( GTF ) is used , good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative . In addition to Type II diabetes , chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma , again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned Since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease , this possible link with chromium isn't too surprising . Glucoma is a little more interesting . Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose-driven metabolic function . If this eye focusing activity is impaired ( by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response ) , intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated . In a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma , the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium . J . Am . Coll . Nutr . 10 ( 5 ): 536 , ( 1991 ) . But this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements . For one thing , just about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts ( yeast ) . Since glucoma is often found in older people , it's not too surprising that chromium was low in the RBC's . If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma , that would prompt some attention . I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma . You could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC chromium test or hair analysis . Most clinical labs are not going to run a RBC chromium . There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you , but I wouldn't use them . There is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now . Here's Weinsier and Morgan , advise on chromium . They do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available ( they don't like the hair and nail analysis labs either , and they also recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs ) . This has to change and as more labs run a RBC chromiuum , it will . What then do they suggest ? Make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium ( run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation ) . Once you make the diagnosis , put the patient on 200ug of CrCl 3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day . What's my advise ? Don't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight ( they just do not work that way ) . If you want to take them and then exercise , that would be great . Do include yeast as part of your diet ( most Americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet ) . If you do have a poor glucose tolerance , ask your doctor to check your chromium status . When he or she says , " what in the world are you talking about " , just say , please get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan's new Clinical Nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance . If you can't do that , I'll find a doctor who can , thank you very much .

However the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard Kuhn / Lakatos / Feyerabend view of " progress " and " rationality " in science . Since I've addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past , I won't go into them again now . What is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression ( and you may not in fact hold this view ) that the common ( perhaps even the " correct " ) approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds . It further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes " forward " ( and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs ) by generating in a completely non-rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the " critical function " of science . ( Though why this critical function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery . If experimental design , hypotheses creation , and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds , then this must be equally true of the application of any " critical function " concerning replication . This is what leads one ( ala Feyerabend ) to an " anything goes " view . ) True , the generation part * can * be totally irrational . But typically it is * not * . Anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science . - - Gary H .

I was there in 1976 . I suppose it must have died out since 1946 , then . Certainly I never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the NHS . Perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths . A similar law in the US allows chiropractors to practice in VA hospitals but I've never seen one there and I don't know of a single VA that has hired a chiropractor .

Interesting statements , simply because I have been told otherwise . I'm certainly not questioning Steve's claims , as for one I am not a doctor , and I agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's . But inflammation can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food . Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection ( is that a good enough caveat :-) , I was told that a * LOW RESIDUE * diet is called for . Basically , the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut ( which may not be realized by the patient ) , any residue in the system can be caught in the folds of inflammation and constantly irritate , thus exacerbating the problem . Therefore , anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common inflammation should be avoided . With what I've been told is typical Crohn's , of the terminal ileum , my diet should be low residue , consisting of : Completely out - never again - items : o corn ( kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-) o popcorn ( same ) o dried ( dehydrated ) fruit and fruit skins o nuts ( Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-) Discouraged greatly : o raw vegetables ( too fibrous ) o wheat and raw grain breads o exotic lettuce ( iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water ) o greens ( turnip , mustard , kale , etc ... ) o little seeds , like sesame ( try getting an Arby's without it ! ) o long grain and wild rice ( husky ) o beans ( you'll generate enough gas alone without them ! ) o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing I was told that the more processed the food the better ! ( rather ironic in this day and age ) . The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your system as little chance to inflame as possible . I was told that among the NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged ( I only listed a few ) , to try the ones I wanted and see how I felt . If it's bad , don't do it again ! Remember though that this was while I was in remission . For Veggies : cook the daylights out of them . I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more thoroughly - you're mileage may vary . As with anything else , CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR . Don't just take my word . But this is the info I've been given , and it may be a starting point for discussion . Good luck ! - Spenser - - S .

Do I assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer ? I was just wondeing , since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist . A bone scan is a nuclear scan . Thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer , and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body . The tracer is usually given intravenously . ( IV ) This means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein . After a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body , the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer . The radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it . As far as pain , the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the IV line . What the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer . This is also why I was wondering if your mother has had cancer , since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system . I hope I have answered some of your questions . Feel free to e-mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother's care . I'm a newly graduated nurse , and I enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before . My thoughts are with you both . Elisa B .

My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr .

On the other hand , my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the " yeast connection " . But , I believe there is some truth to the book . Hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction . In the meantime , I'd still encourage people who have " incurable " chronic sinus problems ( especially if they overused antibiotics ) , to find a doctor to administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole ( along with liver panels before , during and after treatment just to play it safe ) . It is an empirical approach for sure , but when all else fails , and your ENT says " sorry , you'll just have to live with it " , it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence ( Dr . Ivker ) , supported by plausible theories ( outlined by Marty ) . At this stage you have little to lose , particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in Europe and the U . S . to be very minimal with relatively healthy ( i . e . , non-AIDS ) patients . I'm glad I did this , since I saw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox ( itraconazole ) .

Not all kidney stones have calcium and not all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate . But the vast majority are calcium - oxalate . Calcium is just one piece of the puzzle . I cited that NEJM article as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that conventional wisdom is used in medicine , always has been and probably always will be . If one uses conventional wisdom , there is a chance that you will be wrong . As long as the error is not going to cause a lot of damage , what's the big deal ( why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to sinus suffers or GI distress patients a quack ? ) . On the kidney stone problem . I'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical chemistry lab . Balance is much more important than the dietary intake of calcium . I know that you use an electrical conductance technique to measure mineral balance in the body . I know that you don't think that the serum levels for minerals are very useful ( I agree ) . If I can get a good nutritional assessment lab setup where I can actually measure the tissue reserve for minerals , I'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see how your technique compares with mine .

This is a lovely area for anecdotes , but I am sure you are on to something . As a physician , I almost never get sick : usually , when something horrendous is going around , I either don't get it at all or get a very mild case . When I do get really sick , it is always something unusual . This was not the situation when I was in medical school , particularly on pediatrics . I never had younger siblings myself , and when I went on the pediatric wards I suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for . Pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness , and I had a temp of 104 when I took the final exam ! I think what happens is that during training , and beyond , we are constantly exposed to new things , and we have the usual reactions to them , so that later on , when challenged with something , it is more likely a re-exposure for us , so we deal with it well and get a mild illness . I don't think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way . Also , don't forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home , and we carry a lot of that around . - kmFrom : koreth@spud.Hyperion.COM ( Steven Grimm ) Subject : Re : Opinions on Allergy ( Hay Fever ) shots ?

I post it , along with the other FAQ stuff . If you have questions , you want to send mail to Richard , not me . - - Dan Software Tools to help with RSI - - - This file describes tools , primarily software , to help prevent or manage RSI . This version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar programs and digital watches ... Please let me know if you know any other tools , or if you have information or opinions on these ones , and I will update this FAQ . I am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people who have evaluated them or are using them . Richard Donkin Internet mail : richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Tel : + 44 71 814 5708 ( direct ) Fax : + 44 71 251 2853 Changes in this version : Added information on StressFree , another typing management tool for Windows . TYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS : these aim to help you manage your keyboard use , by warning you to take a break every so often . The better ones also include advice on exercises , posture and workstation setup . Some use sound hardware to warn of a break , others use beeps or screen messages . Often , RSI appears only after many years of typing , and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too : frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening . These tools act as an early warning system : by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises , you don't have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is , getting RSI . Tool : At Your Service ( commercial software ) Available from : Bright Star Tel : +1 (206) 451 3697 Platforms : Mac ( System 6.0 . 4 ) , Windows Description : Provides calendar , keyboard watch , email watch , and system info . Warns when to take a break ( configurable ) . Has a few recommendations on posture , and exercises . Sound-oriented , will probably work best with sound card ( PC ) or with microphone ( Mac ) . Should be possible to record your own messages to warn of break . Tool : AudioPort ( sound card and software ) Available from : Media Vision Tel : +1 (510) 226 2563 Platforms : PC Description : A sound card to plug into your PC parallel port . Includes ' At Your Service ' . Tool : Computer Health Break ( commercial software ) Available from : Escape Ergonomics , Inc 1111 W . El Camino Real Suite 109 Mailstop 403 Sunnyvale , CA Tel : +1 (408) 730 8410 Platforms : DOS Description : Aimed at preventing RSI , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval , based on clock time , or after a set number of keystrokes - - whichever is earlier . It gives you 3 exercises to do each time , randomly selected from a set of 70 . Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do - data entry , word processing , information processing . Exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does . CHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use to learn more about RSI and how to prevent it . Other information on non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer . A full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included . CHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows , but does not then warn you when to take a break ; it does not therefore appear useful when used with Windows . Cost : $ 79.95 ; quantity discounts , site licenses . Comments : The keystroke-counting approach looks good : it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time . The marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers , as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for RSI management tools . Tool : EyerCise ( commercial software ) Available from : RAN Enterprises One Woodland Park Dr . Haverhill , MA 01830 , US Tel : 800-451-4487 ( US only ) Platforms : Windows ( 3.0 / 3.1 ) , OS / 2 PM ( 1.3 / 2.0 ) [ Not DOS ] Description : Aimed at preventing RSI and eye strain , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval ( or at fixed times ) . Optionally displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the correct rate . Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training exercises , can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes . Also includes online help on workplace ergonomics . Quote from their literature : " EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises . The stretches work all parts of your body , relieving tension and helping to prevent Repetitive Strain Injury . The visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain . Together these help you to become more relaxed and productive . " " The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress _ by Edward C . Godnig , O . D . and John S . Hacunda , which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use . Cost : $ 69.95 including shipping and handling , quantity discounts for resellers . Free demo ( $ 5 outside US ) . Comments : I have a copy of this , and it works as advertised : I would say it is better for RSI prevention than RSI management , because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes . Also , it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time , which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day . Worked OK on Windows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure why . Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC , and has one window without window controls . Very usable though , and does not require any sound hardware . Tool : Lifeguard ( commercial software ) Available from : Visionary Software P . O . Box 69447 Portland , OR 97201 , US Tel : +1 (503) 246-6200 Platforms : Mac , DOS ( Windows version underway ) Description : Aimed at preventing RSI . Warns you to take a break with dialog box and sound . Includes a list of exercises to do during breaks , and information on configuring your workstation in an ergonomic manner . Price : $ 59 ; quantity discounts and site licenses . The DOS product is bought in from another company , apparently ; not sure how equivalent this is to the Mac version . The Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher Magazine ( Feb 1991 ) . Good marketing stuff with useful 2 - page summaries of RSI problems and solutions , with references .

Anon FTP : ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( and mirroring sites ) Platforms : Windows ( 3.0 / 3.1 ) ( Mac and DOS versions underway ) Description : Aimed at preventing RSI , this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval ( or at fixed times ) . Displays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are animated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the correct rate . Quite a few exercises , can configure which ones are included to some extent . Online help . Version 2.0 is out soon , Mac and DOS versions will be based on this . Cost : $ 29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet , otherwise $ 39.95 . Site license for 3 or more copies is $ 20.00 each . ( NOTE : prices may have gone up for V2 . 0 ) . Comments : I have had a play with this , and it works OK . Its user interface design is much better in 2.0 , though still a bit unusual . expensive tool around and it does the job . It is also the only tool with a redistributable demo , so if you do get the demo , post it on your local bulletin boards , FTP servers and Bitnet servers ! Does not include general info on RSI and ergonomics , but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence , which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises . Tool : Typewatch ( freeware ) , version 3.8 ( October 1992 ) Available from : Email to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu :p ub / typing-injury / typewatch.shar Platforms : UNIX ( tested on SCO , SunOS , Mach ; character and X Window mode ) Description : This is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing , based on how long you have been continuously typing . It does not provide exercises , but it does check that you really do take a break , and tells you when you can start typing again . Typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today , each time it warns you , which is useful so you know how much you * really * type . It also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out . The warning message appears on your screen ( in character mode ) , in a pop-up window ( for X Windows ) , or as a Zephyr message ( for those with Athena stuff ) . Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> has put in a lot of bug fixes , extra features and support for X , Zephyr and Mach . Not formally supported , but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk ( for SCO , SunOS , character mode ) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu ( for Mach , X Window mode , Zephyr ) if you have problems or want to give feedback . Tool : Various calendar / batch queue programs Available from : Various sources Platforms : Various Description : Any calendar / reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool . Or , any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen . Using Windows as an example : create a Calendar file , and include this filename in your WIN.INI ' s ' load = ' line so you get it on every startup of Windows . Suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes , starting from 9 am . Press F7 ( Special Time ... ) to enter an appointment , enter 9:30 , hit Enter , and type some text in saying what the break is for . Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry , and repeat for the next appointment . By using Windows Recorder , you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a . REC file . Put this file on your ' run = ' line , as above , and you will then , with a single keypress , be able to set up your daily appointments with RSI exercises . The above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs . An example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break ; this will depend a lot on your operating system . While these approaches are not ideal , they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI management tool . If you are techie enough you might want to write a version of Typewatch ( see above ) for your operating system , using batch jobs or whatever fits best . Tool : Digital watches with count-down timers Available from : Various sources , e . g . Casio BP - 100 . Description : Many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes ; they usually reset easily to that number , either manually or automatically . While these are a very basic tool , they are very useful if you are writing , reading , driving , or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI . The great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing . Comments : My own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more , and still reading as much as ever , which actually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left arm improved . Getting a count-down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day . I have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer , but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period ! KEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS : these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout . One-handed typing tools may help , but be VERY careful about how you use them - - if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing , and may therefore make matters worse . Tool : hsh ( public domain ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu :p ub / typing-injury / hsh.shar Platforms : UNIX ( don't know which ones ) Description : Allows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings . Only works through tty's ( so , you can use it with a terminal or an xterm , but not most X programs ) . Tool : Dvorak keyboard tools ( various ) Available from : Anonymous ftp : soda.berkeley.edu :p ub / typing-injury / xdvorak . c Also built into Windows 3 . x . Description : The Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use . It * may * help prevent RSI a bit , but you can also use it if you have RSI , since it will slow down your typing a * lot * :-) - - Dan Wallach " One of the most attractive features of a Connection dwallach@cs.berkeley.edu Machine is the array of blinking lights on the faces Office # : 510-642-9585 of its cabinet .

The drug , which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone progesterone , protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection . The hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy . It is more than 99 percent effective . " This drug presents another long-term , effective option for women to prevent pregnancy , " said FDA Commissioner David A . Kessler , M . D . " As an injectable , given once every three months , Depo Provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose . " Depo Provera is available in 150 mg . single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection . If a patient decides to become pregnant , she discontinues the injections . As with any such products , FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it . Depo Provera's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer , the World Health Organization and health agencies in other countries . U . S . clinical trials , begun in 1963 , also found Depo Provera effective as an injectable contraceptive . The most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain . In addition , some patients may experience headache , nervousness , abdominal pain , dizziness , weakness or fatigue . The drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease , unexplained vaginal bleeding , breast cancer or blood clots in the legs , lungs or eyes . The labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug , due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 14 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Recent data have also demonstrated that long-term use may contribute to osteoporosis . The manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect . Depo Provera was Developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries . The UpJohn Company of Kalamazoo , Mich . , which will market the drug under the name , Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection , first submitted it for approval in the United States in the 1970s . At that time , animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause breast cancer . Worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer , including breast cancer in humans , to be minimal if any . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 15 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 New Rules Speed Approval of Drugs for Life-Threatening Illnesses P92 - 37 Food and Drug Administration Monica Revelle - (301) 443-4177 The Food and Drug Administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life - threatening illnesses , such as AIDS , cancer and Alzheimer's disease . " These final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible , " said HHS Secretary Louis W . Sullivan , M . D . " The effort to accelerate FDA review for these drugs has been a long-term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration . " These rules establish procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug based on " surrogate endpoints " or markers . They apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies . Such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient . Use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints - - such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease - - are used . The new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness , based on surrogate endpoints , can be reasonably established . The drug's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug's effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 17 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 :: : Articles :: : Research Shows Promise for Preventing or Slowing Blindness due to Retinal Disease National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Neutrophilic Factors Rescue Photoreceptor Cells in Animal Tests Baltimore , MD - Researchers at the University of California San Francisco and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc . [ NASDAQ : REGN ] have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye . The degeneration of these cells , known as photoreceptors , is a major cause of visual impairment This research , published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science ( PNAS ) , holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration - - currently , no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists . It is estimated that 2.5 million Americans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and 100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus , a hereditary disease that causes blindness . In addition , each year more than 15,000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas . The research was funded in part by the RP ( Retinitis Pigmentosa ) Foundation Fighting Blindness , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye Institute . It was conducted by Drs . Matthew M . LaVail , Kazuhiko Unoki , Douglas Yasurnura , Michael T . Matthes and Roy H . Steinberg at UCSF , arld Dr . C ; eorge Yancoooulos , Regeneron's Vice President for Discovery . Regeneron holds an exclusive license for this research from UCSF . In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to assess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances . Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week . Eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells - - the rods and cones of the retina - - after light exposure . Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) and Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor ( CNTF ) were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects ; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) and Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF - 1 ) were not effective in these experiments . Discussing the research , Dr . Jesse M . Cedarbaum , Regeneron's Director of Clinical Research , said , " BDNF's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age - related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision impairment , and for retinal detachment . Following detachment , permanent vision loss may HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 18 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 result frorn the death of detached retinal cells . It is possible that BDNF could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached surgically . " " Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades . Vision decreases to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness . It is our hope that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression and preserve useful vision throughout life , " stated Jeanette S . Felix , Ph . D . , Director of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness . In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in conjunction with Aingen Inc . [ NASDAQ : AMGN ] as a possible treatment for peripheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy , motor neuron diseases , Parkinson's disease , and Alzheimer's disease . By itself , Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease ) . Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals , Inc . , based in Tarrytown , New York , is a leader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases , peripheral neuropathies and nerve injuries , which affect more than seven million Americans .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 19 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Affluent Diet Increases Risk Of Heart Disease Research Resources Reporter written by Mary Weideman Nov / Dec 1992 National Institutes of Health High-fat , high-calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat . These findings , according to investigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland , have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries . " This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels . It shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight , thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well , " explains principal investigator Dr . William E . Connor , head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University . Over the past 25 years Dr . Connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico , while simultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism . These native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra Madre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua . The Tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing . Probably as a result , coronary heart disease , which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations , is virtually non existent in their culture . Loosely translated , the name Tarahumara means " fleet of foot , " reflecting a tribal passion for betting on " kickball " races , in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete-carved wooden ball . The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans , tortillas , and pinole , a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water , together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables . The Tara humaras also eat small amounts of game , fish , and eggs . Their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority ( 69 percent ) is of vegetable origin . Dietician Martha McMurry , a coinvestigator in the study , describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat . The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg / dL , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - cholesterol levels of 72 mg / dl , and high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) - cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg / dl . All of those values are in the good , low-risk range , according to the researchers . Elevated cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 20 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 disease . HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial . In previous studies the Tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease , although able to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL - cholesterol . Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria Teresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi . Food was weighed , cooked , and fed to the study participants under the investigators ' direct supervision , ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol . Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly , and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr . Connors laboratory for cholesterol , triglyceride , and lipoprotein analyses . Regular measurements included participant body weight , height , and triceps skin fold thickness . Thirteen Tarahumaras , five women and eight men , including one adolescent , were fed their native diet for 1 week , followed by 5 weeks of an " affluent " diet . " In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories . This is the prototype of the holiday diet that many Americans consume a diet high in fat , sugar , and cholesterol , low in fiber , " elaborates Dr . Conners . Such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol-saturation index , or CSI , recently devised research dietitian Sonja Conner working with Dr . Connor . " The CSI is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet . CSI indicates the diet's potential to elevate the cholesterol level , particularly the LDL , " Dr . Connor explains . The Tarahumaran diet averages a very low CSI of 20 ; Dr . Connor's " affluent " diet used in the study ranks a CSI of 149 . The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels , typical of the native diet , before exposing subjects to the experimental diet . The standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off , or plateau , for consumption of large amounts of fat . Changes in dietary fat and / or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels . " You must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet . The Framingham study , for example , did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat . All subjects were already eating on a plateau , " Dr . Connor says . After 5 weeks of consuming the " affluent " diet , the subjects ' mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent , primarily in the LDL fraction , which rose 39 percent . HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent , and LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little . Plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent , and subjects averaged an 8-p ound gain in weight . According to Dr . Connor , lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon , yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days . HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 21 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations . " We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic study . In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption . In the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories . We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol . HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat , and it increased quite a bit in this study , " Dr . Connor explains . Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol . HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because of their usual high fat intake . Dr . Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat , less than 100 mg of cholesterol , and a CSI around 20 , varying in accordance with caloric needs . Such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat , high in fiber . Dr . Connor also comments on recent suggestions that Americans adopt a " Mediterranean-style " diet . " The original Mediterranean diet , in its pristine state , consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products . We are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products . Simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation . " The World Health Organization ( WHO ) is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development . Dr . Connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society's elite , who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen . " If the pattern of afluence increases , the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease , which places a termendous health care burden on a society . WHO would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease , so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well-being , rather than paying for unnecessary , expensive medical technology , " Dr . Connors says . " The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a very short time by an affluent , excessive diet . The present rate of coronary heart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago , so a lot has been accomplished . We are changing rapidly , " he concludes .

Although not many patients with Hep B go on to chronic hepatitis , it does still occur in a good number ( 20 % ? ) and is something to keep in mind . Hepatitis C ( was : non-A , non-B Hep ) much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis . There is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis . Of course , cirrhosis is a most unkind disease . The most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function . Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas , among many other problems , as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation . Less ominously , they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis . These effects include telangiactasias ( small red skin lesions ) and , in men , gynecomastia ( breast development ) . The only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant . Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected , at least statistically , in your friend's case . Nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor . Hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to you , and offer you support .

Not to drag this out anymore , but ... Many veterinarians feel that Lyme Disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area , they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness , swollen joints , + / - fever . A recent paper ( March 1993 ) has finally established that Lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting . This has been an ellusive matter for researchers , and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease . Up to now , only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to " prove " that the disease exists . This paper is noteworthy in two other regards : 1 ) None of the animals they infected were treated in any way . The dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6-8 week period which occurred 2-5 months after exposure . After this period , none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study . So these are proven , clinically sick Lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment . Of course , observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn't have the same chronicity that some see in humans . 2 ) The addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine . Of course , they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy . Anyway , maybe we will see some independent , scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so . - - Jeff Parke <jeffp@pgavin1.vetmed.wsu.edu> also : jeffp@WSUVM1.bitnet AOL : JeffParke Washington State University College of Veterinary Medicine class of 1994 Pullman , WA 99164-7012From : geb@cs.pitt.edu ( Gordon Banks ) Subject : Re : Helium non-renewable ? ?

We are now mapping the human genome . We will ; then start to work on manipulation of that genome . Using genetic ; engineering , we will be able to insert whatever genes we want . ; No breeding , no " hybrids " , etc . The ethical question is , should ; we ? Two past problems with eugenics have been 1 ) reducing the gene pool and 2 ) defining the status of the eugenized . Inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny . Then they may be able to crowd out " garbage genes . " This may in the future become possible . Even if it does , awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later . Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa and for diabetes in the Hopi * promoted * survival in some conditions . We don't really know what the future may hold for our environment . The reduced wilderness - and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind . Vulcanism , nuclear winter , ice age , meteor impact , new microbiological threats , famine , global warming , etc . , etc . , are all conceivable . Therefore , having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival . Of course , the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else's . But if we could make " philosopher-kings " with great bodies and long lives , would we ( or they ) want to give them elevated status ? We could . The Romans did it with their kings * without * the benefits of such eugenics . The race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused , but for a while , it was a problem . Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks . But there is nothing new under the sun . We treated slaves the same way for millennia before " 1984 . " I see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems . Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time . That hasn't stopped the race as a whole yet . Many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change . However , also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power . The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others , and have survived by making better choices when their turns came . Not that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering . Nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that , too . The real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue . I personally don't think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few . We , as eugenists , may make it , an we may not . If we don't , I hope there are reservoirs of " garbage " people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded " garbage " genes which will pull us through . I believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same . Man needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has . Some men have , and I believe all men may , listen to and obey the still small voice of God in their hearts . This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices . Peoples have died out for many reasons . The societies which failed to accept enough input from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves , and often others in the process . It is self-evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far , or else haven't had enough power for long enough . In summary , I would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one . And the answer , in some ways hard , in some ways easy , is the same ancient answer . It isn't the power , it is the Spirit . Sorry for the long post . Got carried away .

No arguments about migranous aura ; in fact , current best evidence is that aura is intrinsicially neuronal ( a la spreading depression of Leao ) rather than vascular ( something causing vasoconstriction and secondary neuronal ischemia ) . Migraine without aura , however , is a fuzzier issue . There do not seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function . The Copenhagen mafia ( Lauritzen , Olesen , et al ) have done local CBF studies on migraine without aura , and ( unlike migraine with aura , but like tension-type ) they found no changes in LCBF . From one ( absurd ) perspective , * all * pain is neurologic , because in the absence of a nervous system , there would not be pain . From another ( tautologic ) perspective , any disease is in the domain of the specialty that treats it . Neurologists treat headache , therefore ( at least in the USA ) headache is neurologic . Whether neurologic or not , nobody would disagree that disabling headaches are common . Perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic colleagues , scrounging for cases , want all the headache patients they can get .

A recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10-20 db down at 1000cps . Then it falls off a cliff to 70-80 dbs down from 1500cps on . This type of loss is difficult to fit . I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional , but leave a lot to be desired . Recently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks . These have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed . I found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called ReSound . Unfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them ' head to head ' with the Widex . Nevertheless , it did appear to me that they were superior and I was impressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I will give in a separate posting . They also carry the Widex aids and had one patient ( presumably wealthy ) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound even though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago . The problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the Widex and other programmable aids . I could take a trip to Europe on the difference ! Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money , I am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds . I would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite so expensive . - Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu> University of Oregon , Eugene , OR , USAFrom : sdr@llnl.gov ( Dakota ) Subject : Re : HELP for Kidney Stones ...

SteveFrom : jer@prefect.cc.bellcore.com ( rathmann , janice e ) Subject : Re : Sinus vs . Migraine ( was Re : Sinus Endoscopy ) I noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly , ( motrin at the time ) , I seemed to get a lot of migraines . But had forgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here . I generally don't take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches , because I've found them to be ineffective . However , I have two other pain sources that force me to take NSAIDS ( currently Naprosyn ) . First , is some pelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period , and then much worse at midcycle . I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past ( ~ 12 years ago ) , so the Drs . tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back . I've tried Synarel , it reduced the pain while I took it ( 3 mos ) , but the pain returned immediately after I stopped . Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only " real solution " to my problem . Although I don't expect to have any more children , I don't like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed ( the first ovary was removed when I had the surgery for endometriosis ) . One of the Drs that suggested I get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery , but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children . So basically all I'm left with is toughing out the pain . This would be impossible without Naprosyn ( or something similar - but not aspirin , that doesn't work , and Motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago , so I'm through with it ) . In fact , Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take it regularly as I did when I had severe back pain ( and pain in both legs ) as I'll discuss in a moment . Generally though , I wait until I have the pain before I take the Naprosyn , but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain ( it's actually quite effective at reducing the pain , it just takes quite a while ) . In the meantime I'm frequently in severe pain . The other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy . I've had MRIs , Xrays , CT scan , and EMGs ( I've had 2 of them , and don't intend to ever do that again ) with nerve conduction tests . The tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain . The MRI reports both say I have several bulging , degeneratig disks , and from the Xrays ( and MRI , I think ) it is apparent that I have arthritis . The reading on the CT scan was that there are two herniations ( L3 - L4 , and L4 - L5 ) , but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations . The second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first EMG . Oh yeah , I had some other horrible test , called something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the " internal nerves " are working fine . Anyway , the bottom line is that I sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain . The back pain is there all the time , but I can live with it . When the leg pain is there , I need some analgesic / anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where I can work . So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9 months ( every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse , so I'd always resume ) . Since last November I have taken it much less frequently , and primarily for the pelvic pain . I have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months ( 2-3 times a week ) . After the first month or so , my therapist put me on pelvic traction ( she had tried it earlier , but it had caused a lot of pain in my back , this time she tried it at a lower weight ) . After a month or two , the pain in my legs began going away ( but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back , which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage ) . So now , I don't have nearly as much pain in my legs , in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago . Getting back to my original reason for this post ... Even if I can avoid taking analgesic for headaches , I really can't avoid them entirely because I have other pain sources , that " force " me to use them ( Oh , I forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery , but I'm avoiding that too ) . I find the migraines difficult to deal with , occassionally I have to take off work , but usually I can work , but at a reduced capacity ( I'm a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing ) . When the pelvic pain is bad , I can't concentrate much , I usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes , because the pain is so bothersome . When the pain in my back is bad , it can cause severe burning in both legs , shooting pains in my legs , electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes , and basically when it gets bad I can't really sit at all . Then I end up spending most of my time home and in bed . So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines , the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources . I get a lot of migraines , an average of 3 to 4 a month , which last 1-3 days . I've taken cafergot ( the first time the caffiene really got to me so I reduced the dosage ) , but I don't like the side effects ( if I take more than two I get diahrea ) . If I get a very bad headache , I will eventually take the cafergot . My neurologist wasn't very helpful when I told him my problems with cafergot , he said that when sumatriptan becomes available , I should try that . I've tried several other medications ( fiornal , midrin , fiornal with codeine , tegretol , and inderal ) but they either didn't work , or I couldn't tolerate them . So what can I do ? My doctor's seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain , which I agree with most of the time , but not when I have a lot of pain . I've had some bad experiences with surgery ( my heart stopped once from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the succinylcholine ) , and I've already had surgery several times . Anyway , the point of what I'm saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines , some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain .

His father was the same , so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate into something disfiguring . But I know kids are senstitive about their appearance . I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from acne treatment . I want to help - but with appropriate treatment . My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp . Sort of teenage cradle cap . Any pointers / advice on this ? We have tried a couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to make the condition worse , not better .

That's because these " peer-reviewed " studies are not addressing the effects of MSG in people , they're looking at animal models .

You're being intellectually dishonest ( or just plain confused ) , because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other . Olney's reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants , but that's not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of MSG in most foods , nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects ( for obvious reasons . ) It says nothing about MSG's contribtion to the phenomenon of the " Chinese Restaurant Syndrome " .

Well , making a career out of it is a bit strong . I still believe that doing your own research is very , very necessary . I would not have progressed as much as I have today , unless I had spent the many hours in Stanford's Med Library as I have done . And 5 years ago , it was clear that there was no medicine that would help me . So should I have stopped searching . Thank goodness I didn't . Now I found that there is indeed medicine that helps me . I think that what you've said is kind of idealistic . That you would go to one doctor , get a diagnosis , maybe get a second opinion , and then move on with your life . Just as an example ... having seen 6 of the top specialists in this field in the country , I have received 6 different diagnoses . These are the top names , the ones that people come to from all over the country . I have HAD to sort all of this out myself . Going to a support group ( and in fact , HEADING that support group ) was helpful for a while , but after a point , I found it very unproductive . It was much more productive to do library research , make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself . A recent movie , Lorenzo's Oil , offers a perfect example of what I'm talking about . If you haven't seen it , you should . It's not a put down of doctor's and neither is what I'm saying . Doctors are only human and can only do so much . But there are those of us out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed . I guess I'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things that is still so unknown . If I had a broken arm , or a weak heart , or failing kidneys , I might not have the same opinion . That's because those things are much more tangible and have much more concise definitions and treatments . With dizziness , you just have to decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to find your way out of it . I have chosen the latter .

All the clamor over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved ( to me anyway ) that laetril was ineffective against cancer . A physician who continued to use it , when better , more effective , treatments are available , may deserve to be called a quack . Anti-fungals are in a different class . The big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that * could * be due to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics ? Gorden Rubenfeld , through e-mail , has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with * good * bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body . I do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice . He deals with critical care patients where fungal infection ( systemic ) is a real problem and just because he tries to keep * good * bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this . I think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida . Women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams . Since candida colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area , GI symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use . The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom . The arguement is that without proof , no action is warrented . Medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way . There has always been the use of conventional wisdom . A very good example is kidney stones . Conventional wisdom ( because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention ) , was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming . Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed . Through the recent New England J of Medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong , increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake . The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with * good * bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy . If it makes sense for livestock , why doesn't it make sense for humans David ? We are not talking about a dangerous treatment ( unless you consider yogurt dangerous ) . If this were a standard part of medical practice , as Gordon R . says it is , then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline . Marty B .From : lady@uhunix.uhcc.Hawaii.Edu ( Lee Lady ) Subject : Re : Science and methodology ( was : Homeopathy ... tradition ? ) Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable . However it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity . And in ordinary life , perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder . In the extreme case , a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house . In science , we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries . Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata - - - the search for scope and the search for certainty . If 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and Leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today , because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense , since they lacked the concept of a limit . And in fact , because of the lack of a rigorous foundation , they made a number of errors in their use of calculus . It was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz . Nonetheless , what Newton and Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made .

These are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and sci.psychology . According to these posters " If it's not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it's not science . " Taken to the extreme , I believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science . For one thing , an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade-unionism , where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing . ( I don't in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology . Nonetheless , it is one of the results . ) And although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results , I think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment - - - and using less than perfect empirical methodology - - - will ever come with anything worthwhile . Furthermore , the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is one of the most significant errors in science : choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology ( or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them ) instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance . For instance , certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative . ( One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology . In my opinion , a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's assertion that current scientific methods " avoid all known errors . " ) I think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science . ( Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others . ) And I think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place . - - In the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists , psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects . lady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu lady@uhunix.bitnetFrom : robg@citr.uq.oz.au ( Rob Geraghty ) Subject : Re : Good Grief !

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among 21 reporting countries , exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico ( 1 ) . This report presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC's National Hospital Discharge Survey ( NHDS ) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years . Data on discharges from short-stay , nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the NHDS , conducted by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics . For 1991 , medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals . The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean ( VBAC ) presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 ( 11 % ) women discharged after delivery . The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from national vital registration data . Therefore , estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the NHDS ( 2 ) . Stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95 % confidence level , based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value of 1.96 . In 1991 , there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries , the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 ( Table 1 ) . The primary cesarean rate ( i . e . , number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans ) for 1986-1991 also was stable , ranging from 16.8 to 17.5 . In 1991 , the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6 , significantly ( p < 0.05 ) higher than the rates for the West ( 19.8 ) , Midwest ( 21.8 ) , and Northeast ( 22.6 ) . Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women ; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals ; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals ; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross / Blue Shield * and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment ( Table 2 ) . The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries . Since the early 1970s , the number and percentage of births to older women increased ; however , if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 , the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 , essentially the same as the 23.5 observed . Based on the NHDS , of the approximately 4,111 , 000 live births in 1991 , an HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 1 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 estimated 966,000 ( 23.5 % ) were by cesarean delivery . Of these , an estimated 338,000 ( 35.0 % ) births were repeat cesareans , and 628,000 ( 65.0 % ) were primary cesareans . Since 1986 , approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been performed annually . In 1986 , 8.5 % of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally , compared with 24.2 % in 1991 . Of all cesareans in 1991 , 35.0 % were associated with a previous cesarean , 30.4 % with dystocia ( i . e . , failure of labor to progress ) , 11.7 % with breech presentation , 9.2 % with fetal distress , and 13.7 % with all other specified complications . The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days . In comparison , the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days , and for a repeat cesarean , 4.2 days - - nearly twice the duration for VBAC deliveries ( 2.2 days ) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs ( 2.3 days ) . In 1986 , the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days , for primary cesareans 5.2 days , for repeat cesareans 4.7 days , and for VBAC and non-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days , respectively . Reported by : Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems , National Center for Health Statistics , CDC . Editorial Note : The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 ; however , the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 ( 3 ) . Because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth , a national health objective for the year 2000 ( 4 ) is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries ( objective 14.8 ) . Postpartum complications - - including urinary tract and wound infections - - may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births ( 5 ) . Moreover , the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs . For example , in 1991 , the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $ 7826 and $ 4720 , respectively . The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes $ 611 for physician fees and $ 2495 for hospital charges ( 6 ) . If the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 ( the year 2000 objective ) instead of 23.5 , the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 ( 617,000 versus 966,000 ) , resulting in a savings of more than $ 1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges . Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986 , several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery . For example , VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor , which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 ( 7 ) . Of women who are offered a trial of labor , 50 % - 70 % could deliver vaginally ( 7 ) - - a level already achieved by many hospitals (8 ) . Trial of labor was routinely offered in 46 % of hospitals surveyed in 1984 ( the most recent year for which HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 2 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 national data are available ) ( 9 ) when the VBAC rate ( according to NHDS data ) was 5.7 % . The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35 % , based on all women who had a prior cesarean , regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted . To reach the overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in the VBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate . One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery , by requiring a second opinion , and by instituting a peer-review process ( 10 ) . Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries ; public dissemination of physician - and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices ; and addressing malpractice concerns , which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery ( 4 ) .

Embassy Personnel - - Kampala , Uganda , 1992 = = = SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 The treatment and prevention of malaria in Africa has become a challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance . Although the risk of acquiring malaria for U . S . citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low , this risk varies substantially and unpredictably . During May 1992 , the Office of Medical Services , Department of State ( OMS / DOS ) , and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official U . S . personnel stationed in Kampala , Uganda . A review of the health records from the Embassy Health Unit ( EHU ) in Kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 . EHU , OMS / DOS , and CDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among U . S . Embassy personnel . This report summarizes the results of the investigation . Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were available for review by OMS / DOS and CDC . A case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for Plasmodium sp . Of the 25 persons , 17 were slide - confirmed as having malaria . A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to obtain information about residence , activities , use of malaria chemoprophylaxis , and use of personal protection measures ( i . e . , using bednets and insect repellents , having window and door screens , and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening ) . Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey , 128 (8 2 % ) responded . Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in Kampala . Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years ( 6/32 19 % ) than among persons greater than 15 years ( 11/94 12 % ) , this difference was not significant ( relative risk RR = 1.6 ; 95 % confidence interval CI = 0.6- 4.0 ) . Eighty-two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years , compared with those living there less than 1 year . Travel outside of the Kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria . Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey : mefloquine , chloroquine and proguanil , chloroquine alone , and proguanil alone . In addition , 23 ( 18 % ) persons who responded were not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis . The risk for malaria was significantly lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8 /8 8 9 % ) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis ( 9/37 24 % ) ( RR = 0.4 ; 95 % CI = 0.2- 0.9 ) . Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason . The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 5 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 all or most of the time ( 2/27 7 % ) than among persons who sometimes or rarely used bednets ( 15/99 15 % ) ( RR = 0.5 ; 95 % CI = 0.1- 2.0 ) . The risk for malaria was also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening ( 0/16 ) , compared with those who rarely used repellent ( 17/110 15 % ) ( RR = 0 ; upper 95 % confidence limit = 1.2 ) . Risk for malaria was not associated with failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the evening . As a result of this investigation , EHU staff reviewed with all personnel the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens . EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to provide window and door screens for all personnel . Reported by : U . S . Embassy Health Unit , Kampala , Uganda ; Office of Medical Svcs , Dept of State , Washington , D . C . Malaria Br , Div of Parasitic Diseases , National Center for Infectious Diseases , CDC . Editorial Note : In Uganda , the increase in malaria among U . S . personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan Africa . The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria-endemic areas - - preventive measures that are also important for short-term travelers to such areas . Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most other areas with chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum ; however , in some areas ( e . g . , Thailand ) , resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness . In Africa , the efficacy of mefloquine , compared with chloroquine alone , in preventing infection with P . falciparum is 92 % ( 1 ) . Mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2 - year period . The risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis ( e . g . , psychosis and convulsions ) is low ( i . e . , 1.3- 1.9 episodes per 100,000 users 2 ) , while the risk for less severe adverse reactions ( e . g . , dizziness , gastrointestinal complaints , and sleep disturbances ) is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics ( 1 ) . Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine , but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen ( 3,4 ) . Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance ( e . g . , Southeast Asia and Africa ) . In Africa , for persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline , chloroquine and proguanil is an alternative , although less effective , regimen . Chloroquine should be used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P . falciparum has not been reported .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 7 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 FDA Approval of Use of a New Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine and a Combined Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine for Infants and Children = = = SOURCE : MMWR 42 ( 15 ) DATE : Apr 23 , 1993 Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) conjugate vaccines have been recommended for use in infants since 1990 , and their routine use in infant vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of Hib disease in the United States ( 1-3 ) . Vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the United States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90 % reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these organisms . Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants , a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections . The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against these diseases : 1 ) the Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( tetanus toxoid conjugate , ActHIB Trademark ) , * for vaccination against Hib disease only and 2 ) a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) and Hib conjugate vaccine ( TETRAMUNE Trademark ) , a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and Hib disease . ActHIB Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine , polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate ( PRP-T ) , manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB Trademark by Connaught Laboratories , Inc . ( Swiftwater , Pennsylvania ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2 , 4 , and 6 months . Previously unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart . Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one dose . A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children . Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster . More than 90 % of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark ( consecutive doses at 2 , 4 , and 6 months of age ) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug / mL ( 4 ) . This response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials . Two U . S . efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 8 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 for use in infants ( 4 ) . In these studies , no cases of invasive Hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T . These and other studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed Hib vaccines . TETRAMUNE Trademark On March 30 , 1993 , the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine ( DTP ) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine . TETRAMUNE Trademark , available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals ( Pearl River , New York ) , combines two previously licensed products , DTP ( TRIIMMUNOL Registered , manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River , New York ) and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine ( HibTITER Registered , manufactured by Praxis Biologics , Inc . Rochester , New York ) . This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months - 5 years for protection against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and Hib disease when indications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide . Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines , TETRAMUNE Trademark is expected to provide protection against Hib , as well as diphtheria , tetanus , and pertussis , equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other DTP and Haemophilus b vaccines . The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12 - 15 months ( 5 ) . The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 15-18 months of age , and a booster dose at 4-6 years ( 6-8 ) .

HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 10 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 :: : Dental News :: : International Workshop Explores Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection NIDR Research Digest written by Jody Dove March 1993 National Institute of Dental Research At the Second International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection , held January 31 - February 3 in San Francisco , participants explored issues related to the epidemiology , basic molecular virology , mucosal immunology , and oral clinical presentations of HIV infection . The workshop was organized by Dr . John Greenspan and Dr . Deborah Greenspan of the Department of Stomatology , School of Dentistry , University of California , San Francisco . An international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance . The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries , including Asia , Africa , Europe , Central America , South America , as well as the United States and Canada . Support tor the workshop was provided by the National Institute of Dental Research , the National Cancer Institute , the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , the NIH Office of AIDS Research , and the Procter and Gamble Company . Among the topics discussed were : the epidemiology of HIV lesions ; ethics , professional responsibility , and public policy ; occupational issues ; provision of oral care to the HIV-positive population ; salivary HIV transmission and mucosal immunity ; opportunistic infections ; pediatric HIV infection ; and women's issues . Recommendations Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV , to establish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions , to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations , to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral lesions , and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions . Epidemiology Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection was convened five years ago , the epidemiology of HIV infection has HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 11 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 radically changed . In 1988 , HIV infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males , intravenous drug users , and hemophiliacs . Today , more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents . While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa , a major increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well . Five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time . Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis . They also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression and prognosis . Social / political Issues Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection focused on changing the public's attitude that AIDS is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use . Speakers also addressed health care delivery for HIV-infected patients , and the need to educate the public about what AIDS is , and how it is acquired . Saliva and Salivary Glands Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory activity of saliva , the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions . Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions , which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions . Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity . They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 ) aggregation / agglutination of HIV by saliva , which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell , and 2 ) direct effects on the virus or target cells . Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity . Pediatric Issues Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest . With early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment , the life expectancy of HIV - infected children has tripled . The prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child may be possible in many cases , particularly if the mother's sero-status is known prior to giving birth . Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease HICNet Medical Newsletter Page 12 Volume 6 , Number 11 April 25 , 1993 Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection . Recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology , refinement of diagnostic markers , standardization of study design , and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy . Occupational and Treatment Issues Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals and treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command considerable attention . Factors under consideration include the cost / benefit of HIV testing , patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection and the reverse , and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of HIV-infected patients . Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on the Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less . Proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence Company in late 1993 . - - - end of part 1 - - - - - - Internet : david@stat.com FAX : +1 (602) 451-1165 Bitnet : ATW 1H @ASUACAD FidoNet = > 1:114 / 15 Amateur Packet ax25 : wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.naFrom : kaminski@netcom.com ( Peter Kaminski ) Subject : Re : Krillean Photography [ Newsgroups : m . h . a added , followups set to most appropriate groups . ] In <1993Apr19.205615.1013@unlv.edu> todamhyp@charles.unlv.edu ( Brian M .

A not-overly critical but still useful overview of 32 alternative health therapies . ] ... the Russian engineer Semyon Kirlian and his wife Valentina during the 1950s . Using alternating currents of high frequency to ' illuminate ' their subjects , they photographed them . They found that if an object was a good conductor ( such as a metal ) the picture showed only its surface , while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner structure of the object even if it were optically opaque . They found too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead and living objects . Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones were subject to changes . The object's life activity was also visible in highly variable colour patterns . High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up seriously . Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and others have been produced in Brazil , Austria and Germany . Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people's fingers , notably around those of healers who are concentrating on healing someone . Normally , blue and white rays emanate from the fingers but , when a subject becomes angry or excited , the aura turns red and spotty . The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method . They argue that in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person isn't actually ill but is about to be . They claim to be able to foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase . But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is the phantom effect . During high frequency photography of a leaf from which a part had been cut , the photograph gave a complete picture of the leaf with the removed part showing up faintly . This is extremely important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can ' see ' the legs of amputees as if they were still there . The important thing about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern can't possibly represent a secondary phenomenon - - or the field would vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished . The energy grid contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than the actual object itself .

An excellent article providing common-sense guidelines for evaluating paranormal claims , and some of the author's favorite examples of hokum . ] The crank usually works in isolation from everyone else in his field of study , making grand discoveries in his basement . Many paranormal movements can be traced back to such people - - Kirlian photography , for instance . If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will emit glowing sparks , common knowledge to electrical workers and hobbyists for a century . It took a lone basement crank to declare that the sparks represent some sort of spiritual aura . In fact , Kirlian photography was subjected to rigorous testing by physicists John O . Pehek , Harry J . Kyler , and David L . Faust , who reported their findings in the October 15 , 1976 , issue of Science . Their conclusion : The variations observed in Kirlian photographs are due solely to moisture on the surface of the body and not to mysterious " auras " or even necessarily to changes in mood or mental state . Nevertheless , television shows , magazines , and books ( many by famous parapsychologists ) continue to promote Kirlian photography as proof of the unknown . - - Peter Kaminski kaminski@netcom.comFrom : jhl14@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu ( Jonathan H .

Perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression , or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed , but I know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression . Note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both . Simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present . I don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output , but I would tend to doubt it . As far as I know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain , and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body . A regular everyday depression IMHO should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all . The pituitary bases its secretions of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone ( TSH ) on the level of circulating Thyroxin ( there are two types T3 and T4 - one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other - active - form in the liver ) . The ratio of T3 & T4 can be affected by a number of other hormones ( estrogen , for example ) . Naturally , changing activity of the body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin , but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order . Good sources for info on the thyroid are the Merk Manual ( a physician's reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-) and the Encyclopedia Brittanica ( should be available in your local library ) . I hope this has been of some help . - Eileen BauerFrom : kxgst1+@pitt.edu ( Kenneth Gilbert ) Subject : Re : cats and pregnancy In article <1993Apr27.043035.22609@etl.go.jp> klaus@ipri.go.jp ( Klaus Hofmann ;( 6663 ) ) writes : : Hello , : I heard that a certain disease ( toxoplasmosys ? ) is transmitted by cats which : can harm the unborn fetus .

As far as I can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms and is expirienced its use and interpretation , he should be just as capable of reading it as any radiologist . All doctors are " qualified " to read x-rays , u / s , ct scans etc . it is just that a radiologist does nothing else , and thus , is only better at reading them because of all this time spent doing this ( skill in reading x-rays etc . just comes from plenty of practice ) . If your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by this technique . - Paul . - - | Zikzak public access UNIX , Melbourne , Australia . | ^ ^ ^ | | | | | | / / / < O O > | # # # | / / /From : mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu ( Michael Covington ) Subject : Re : Twitching eyelid I'm surprised nobody mentioned that twitching of the eyelid can be a symptom of an infection , especially if it also itches or stings .

This is certainly among the things I would refer to as quack therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed laetrile ( whether licensed or not ) as a quack . There are unethical behaviors ( such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees ) which I would not lable as quackish , but prescribing known ineffective therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack . - - David Rind rind@enterprise.bih.harvard.eduFrom : geb@cs.pitt.edu ( Gordon Banks ) Subject : Re : My New Diet --> IT WORKS GREAT ! ! !

Surprise surprise , different people react differently to different things . One slightly off the subject case in point . My brother got stung by a bee . I know he is allergic to bee stings , but that his reaction is severe localized swelling , not anaphylactic shock . I could not convince the doctors of that , however , because that's not written in their little rule book . I would not be surprised in the least to find out the SOME people have bad reactions to MSG , including headaches , stomachaches and even vomiting . Not that the stuff is BAD or POISON and needs to be banned , but people need to be aware that it can have a bad effect on SOME people .
