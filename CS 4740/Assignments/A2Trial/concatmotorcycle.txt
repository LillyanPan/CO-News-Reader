Yes , it was specifically the * ability * or understanding of the technique which was absent .

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal " street strategy " , like SIPDE for example , was the most important component of any rider education curriculum . The specific skills of emergency braking , cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced as well , but more significant was that 35 % of rider did NOTHING confronted with a potential accident , and another third collided or fell over as a result of rider error . The choice of specific maneuver is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and the proper execution of ANY effective countermeasure . - - Jerry Lotto <lotto@lhasa.harvard.edu> MSFCI , HOGSSC , BCSO , AMA , DoD #18 Chemistry Dept . , Harvard Univ .

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride ( read : farther than around the block :-) . We'll be riding some twisty , fairly bumpy roads ( the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans ) . Communication : work out your own system . Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while . At reasonable speeds , even on my under-muffled Magna , we can hear each other . It's only above , say , 45 MPH that you can't really communicate . Balance : New passengers are a real pain , because you never know how they're going to react to steering . Some people catch on immediately and lean with me . Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing , and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon . This is a pain while turning , but manageable . The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon , then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the ` correct ' position . This always screws up the line I've picked out . Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers : - attire : helmet , long pants , boots / heavy shoes , jacket . - Keep feet on pegs at all times , unless I say otherwise . Do not get on / off unless I say you can . ( I've had people try to dismount in traffic , just as I'm pulling in to a parking space ! ) - Muffler gets HOT ! ( ' Nuff said ) - We get * GOOD * traction . We're not going to fall over . ( Many first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn ! ) - Turn dynamics : sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and we're going straight . Trust your butt , not your eyes - - if you're confused , close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel of it . Or just hug me tight . - Please , no sudden moves - - shift your weight as desired , but be gradual , so I can compensate . - Your faceplate is yours to open / close as desired . - Trust is essential . Trust the driver ( me ) to do the right thing - - I've driven many miles on this thing , and know how to operate it . Enjoy the ride . ( This is important to stress . For example , one of my first-time passwngers seemed to watch the speedo like a hawk : I drove her to the beach down 84 , and whever we topped 35 mph , she'd holler , " SLOW DOWN ! I'M SCARED " I humored her for a while , then simply covered the speedometer with the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster . Problem solved : she watched the scenery instead of the instruments , and had a much better time . Based on her experience driving a Lincoln Continental , she was unwilling to trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike . ) Usually I'll point out the controls , engine , transmission , brakes , tires , etc . and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers . Helps calm their nerves , and gives the bike a chance to warm up . Watch out for gravel on the Mt . Hamilton road : there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain ; by now , many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little , round , nearly invisible stones . It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner , on the first trip ! Good luck - - have fun ! - - DON'T DRINK SOAP ! DILUTE DILUTE !

If your tastes tend to smaller , more petite ( cough ) churchgoers , it is more likely that they will have a smaller head , and you can safely get a medium or small helmet . This works for me , and I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend , who , at 6 ' 9 " , tends to look more for women that are over 6 ' 0 " , and can't usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had ... Of course , if you aren't picky what size ( * cough * ) churchgoers you give helpful motorcycle rides to , then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any eventuality as far as legality is concerned , and a spare handtowel in the tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport ( rather than the padding above the viewport ) in the cases of extreme mismatch .

If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this , then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase , most noticeably in lower rpm range torque . Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup ( 4.3 l V6 ) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883 . Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs ( which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the same shape , just different sizes ) . Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead , I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense ( plus they look really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head ) - - = = = Neal Howard ' 91 XLH - 1200 DoD #686 CompuTrac , Inc ( Richardson , TX ) doh #0000001200 | 355o33 | neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org Std disclaimer : My opinions are mine , not CompuTrac's .

As I won't be able to make the Joust this summer ( Job related time conflict : ' ^ { ) , I plan instead on going to the Rider Rally in Knoxville . I'll be leaving from Chicago . and generally plan on going down along the Indiana / Illinois border into Kentucky and then Tennessee . I would be very interested in hearing suggestions of roads / routes / areas that you would consider " must ride " while on the way to Knoxville . I can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in Knoxville by 6PM on 5/25 . That leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on the way . By the way if anyone else is going , and would like to partner for the ride down , let me know . I'll be heading east afterward to visit family , but sure don't mind company on the ride down to the Rally . Depending on weather et al . my plan is motelling / tenting thru the trip . From the Rally I'll be heading up the Blue Ridge Parkway , then jogging into West Va ( I - 77 ) to run up 219 -> Marlington , 28 -> Petersburg , 55E -> I - 81 / I - 66E . After this point the route is presently undetermined into Pennsylvania , New York ? , and back to Chicago ( by 6/6 ) . Suggestions for these areas would be of great interest also .

The idea would be to > design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics , and > see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of > us who have bikes are familiar . As you point out , the experiments would be difficult . But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations . There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn . 1 . Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over . 2 . Contact patch having shifted to one side , causing bike to fall over . 3 . Contact patch being accelerated to the side , causing a torque which twists the bike over . Take an average bike / rider , average bike wheel , and at speeds of 5 , 15 , and 50 mph ( say ) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce ( say ) 20 degrees of lean in ( say ) 2 seconds by each effect alone . My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant , and at high speeds 3 is dominant , and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all , relatively speaking . By the way , a similar problem is this : how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast ? Is there a running group where we could start " counter-footing " arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners ? - - Chris Malcolm cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh + 44 ( 0 ) 31 650 3085 Department of Artificial Intelligence , Edinburgh University 5 Forrest Hill , Edinburgh , EH1 2QL , UK DoD #205From : speedy@engr.latech.edu ( Speedy Mercer ) Subject : Re : Living In article <1993Apr05.172836.36759@rchland.ibm.com> pooder@rchland.vnet.ibm.com ( Don Fearn ) writes : > In article <05APR93.02451203.0049@UNBVM1.CSD.UNB.CA> , C70A000 <C70A@UNB.CA> writes : > | > > | > ...

If your distance calc is correct for an " on the road distance " ( and not as the crow flies ) , this is 900km a day for 5 days . If you spend the entire time on interstates , which would be a total waste of time , that's at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating / peeing / sight-seeing etc . I was contemplating a similar trip , but from Ottawa to LA , or maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx . I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it , I'd have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of time enjoying the country around me ; i . e . stopping with a camera , meeting towns-people , going to a few bars . No sense spending 2 weeks looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas pump . I estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile . > I am looking for input , opinions , comments , or snarky remarks on : > 1 . My sanity . In question 8: ) > 2 .

Well , I used to get mad , and either try to communicate my anger to jerks , or to , uhm , educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic . Now I just try to get them off my tail . In heavy traffic I slow down a bit , mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind , but I also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes , switch into one of them , and pass me - which is fine , because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind , while looking ahead , rather than from in front , while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors . In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass , I might pull over , as if to look for a street number or name , ( still ignoring the jerk ) just to get the jerk off my tail . If this all sounds , well , wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic , or perhaps ( for any psych types ) passive-aggressive , consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding , rather than from yelling at jerks . A ride can improve my whole day , while yelling at a jerk is likely ( for me ) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger . In the worst case , yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed ( with the cage ) than I am on a bike . On the other hand , you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections , leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic ( and thus off your tail ) , or crossing illegally ( hopefully in front of the waiting police ) .

My two cents , AlanFrom : CGKarras@world.std.com ( Christopher G Karras ) Subject : Need Maintenance tips After reading the service manual for my bike ( Suzuki GS500E - - 1990 ) I have a couple of questions I hope you can answer : When checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill cap , does one check it with the cap screwed in or not ? I am more used to the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully , wiped clean and reinserted fully , then withdrawn and read . The dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it . Do I remove the cap , wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with / without screwing it down before reading ? The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No . 1207B on the head cover . I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material . do you know of a generic ( cheaper ) substitute ? My headlight is a Halogen 60/55 W bulb . Is there an easy , brighter replacement bulb available ? Where should I look for one ? As always , I very much appreciate your help . The weather in Philadelphia has finally turned WARM .

My regulator lasted over 100,000 miles , and didn't overcharge the battery . The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though , tending to melt their insulation . I suspect they were underspecified ; it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air . Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal .

Are there traditional 1 ) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension , adjust it to a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves . 2 ) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are : a ) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down . Not when you stop at a STOP sign , not when she thinks you're gonna crash , never . Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike . b ) She is to hold onto your waist . She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit . And ( added bonus for you here ) , she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank . You decide how best to word this . c ) Just stay perpendicular to the bike ; straight up in the seat . Don't lean your body into curves , just go with the bike and stay perpendicular .

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime . That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one , you are still innocent until proven guilty . Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes , anyone who witnesses a crime can do so . Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation , give them a description of the car and the license number , and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute ( ie , search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy ) . Fill out the ticket and sign it . It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through . If contested , you will have to appear in court to prosecute .

The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road . Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible . So , to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO . Now to countersteering in particular . Countersteering is something that must be trained . A common reaction among new bikers ( or bicycle riders ) in an emergency situation , is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle . As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended . Needless to say , this is dangerous . I have a specific example : A rider in a left turn . The rider thinks he / she is to close to the right shoulder of the road , and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle . The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road . A worse scenario : The same rider , same turn . In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him / her . The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it . The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations , AND what to do if in one . Thus , the knowledge ( and training ) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course . - - staal@idt.unit.noFrom : fields@cis.ohio-state.edu ( jonathan david fields ) Subject : Question ? ? ?

Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel . > I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you > really in actuality avoid such an incident ? Suggestions ? The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and stall my bike . And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear . So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers . I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line . ( Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country ) If I can't split ( perhaps there isn't room ) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape , and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped . I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will ! Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop , I haven't had to find out yet . Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly , so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not ! So in summary , position yourself for an easy exit , and then watch your mirrors until it's all clear . - - Paul Thompson Apple ComputerFrom : moseley@u.washington.edu ( Steve L .

I have a 6 ' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley ( she doesn't get out much anymore , so I don't use the lock that often anymore ) . It is made of 3/4 " articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable . It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders , but , unfortunately , professionals can open it rather easily : 1 ) Freeze a link . 2 ) Break frozen link with your favorite method ( hammers work well ) . 3 ) Snip through the steel cables ( which , I have on authority , are frightfully thin ) with a set of boltcutters . For the same money , you can get a Kryptonite cable lock , which is anywhere from 1/2 " to 7/8 " thick steel cable ( looks like steel rope ) , shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish , and has a barrel-type locking mechanism . I don't know if it's adjustable , but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks , and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear ( 5/8 " model ) . All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel . Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute . FYI , I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck .

A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all . One thing to look for , BTW , is a soft front end .

April 4 , 1993 re : Cecil King's Nominating Statement Dear Chick : We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year . Cecil King's nominating statement ( as it appeared in the Owners News ) is 968 words , nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws . In pertinent part , the rules state : " Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words . The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length . Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task . Had Cecil's statement been cut as required , it would have concluded approximately with the word " undertiding " [ sic ] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement . As a result , Cecil has obtained what I view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president . This does not just taint the election for that office ; it makes a mockery of the process . I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election . Parenthetically , in your private correspondence with others , I would be most appreciative that when tou call me an " asshole " you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences . With kind regards , I remain , Robert Higdon O . K .

Couple hours after > you " feel " sober ? What ? Or should I just work with " If I drink tonight , I > don't ride until tomorrow " ? This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago . While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage , I had the opportunity to listen to some of the " creative excuses " offered the judge by others . After listening to a number of " Well , I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up " versions , I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some . He was less than impressed with any of them . This young , rather burley looking guy , had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper . He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone . It was also noted that the defendant ( motorcycle rider ) had alcohol on his breath , but was not cited for this offence . The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice : " Well son , those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle . What do you have to say for your self ? " " Well Sir " , meekly the defenant replied , " I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home . " He offered nothing more or less . Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home . The judge moved by the simplicity of the response , fined him the maximum in this case ( plus court costs of course ) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school .

While shopping for a passenger helmet , I noticed that in many cases the external dimensions of the helmets were the same from S through XL . The difference was the amount of inside padding . My solution was to buy a large helmet , and construct a removable liner from a sheet of . 5 " closed-cell foam and some satin ( glued to the inside surface ) .

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs .From : mrc@Ikkoku-Kan.Panda.COM ( Mark Crispin ) Subject : dogs I'm a biker and a dog-lover . First and foremost , I want to mention some common sense . If it's a choice between injuring / killing a dog or getting yourself injured / killed , there is only one rational decision . Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first . Second , it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language . How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game ( and that you're playing with him ) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent . Third , it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog . Dogs are social beasts , and recognize a domination / submission hierarchy . To a dog , there are two types of fellow-creatures ; that which he dominates , and that which dominate him . You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class . You are God : you are easily angered and your anger is terrible . But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance , and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word , a kind word , or even ( oh joy oh rapture unforeseen ) A Dog Bisquit ! Now , how does that all relate to biking ? Well , first , it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game , and not out of overt hostility . The MSF suggestion is a very good one ; when you see the dog coming , slow down so he determines a particular place of interception . Just before you ( and he ) reach that spot , punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone . Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input , and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of . With a hostile dog , or one which you repeatedly encounter , stronger measures may be necessary . This is the face off . First - - and there is very important - - make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory . Face him off on the road , not on his driveway . If necessary , have a large stick , rolled up newspaper , etc . ( something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him ) . Stand your ground , then slowly advance . Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT . The larger the dog , the greater your anger . Dogs will pick up anger , just as they can pick up fear . And , since you and he are not on his home territory , it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory , and that you are prepared to fight to the death . Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage . They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat ( gesture of submission ) and thus they have escaped punishment . The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them . The more effective you are at communicating body language , the less you actually have to do .

When it runs , it runs well . > Good point , did not catch this in the original post . The only other things which come to mind , since this is a gravity feed fuel system , is this . The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the # 1 carburator . Let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock . When it is cold , the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on , since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas , and as the engine and surrounding area warm up , the hole seals up . One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs . Connect a tube of the correct size , preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow , on the output side of the fuel petcock . Remove the control hose from # 1 carburator . Make sure the tank is full . Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose , preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge , to check for air leaks . With vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely . To see if there is a vent problem , do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed , if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open , then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent . I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem . So the things which might be defective are , the control hose from # 1 carb , the petcock valve , and possibly the fuel tank vent . Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , then there is something in the carbs screwed up , but there are so many things to check , I would be typing all day to list them all ! Here are a few , with everything back together , apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow . Open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs , there are quite a few on each carb . I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting . If American Honda does not resolve this , get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE . It is a 800 number , but I don't recall it off the top of my head . I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked the support I received , here would be your chance to tell them what you think !

I just installed a MC Power Arc II , and it seems to run great . I also used MC coils , and neither the ignition module or the coils required any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC . A little soldering and all was fine . Static timing was real easy to set too . On the other side of the coin , my local wrench , whose opinion I invariably seek but don't always adopt , thinks MC Power Arc is a " piece of shit " and says " all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day " .

Some pretty distorted thinking , I > should say . You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these " lesser indiscretions " . If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the " indiscretions " and the partyers aren't either , maybe the " indiscretions " don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults . The only thing that really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans in the street , but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they helped set up the party in the first place . If I lived there and the bikers ' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation and good intentions , I'd certainly rather they stick around and party than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed . > Oh - - I'm sorry , I just noticed that you left mucho bucks ( as in MONEY ) ... > Nevermind my criticism , I was out of line .

That torque , and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor . To a cruiser-motorcyclist , chrome has some importance . To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice . Unless motivated solely by price , these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice . To ignore these , as well as other criteria , would be insensitive . In other words , no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have . ( sometimes it's hard for * any * motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements ) You're fishing for flames , Dave . This difference of opinion is analogous to the difference between Sports-car owners , and luxury-car owners .

Dog attack ! My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something . I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method : Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target , then take off and laugh at the dog , now far behind you . This time , it didn't work because I didn't have time . Riding up the hill leading to my house , I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel ( no relation to the Springer Softail , or the Springer Spagthorpe , a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking ) . Actually , the dog encountered me with intent to harm . But I digress : I was riding near the ( unpainted ) centerline of the roughly 30 - foot wide road , doing between forty and sixty clicks ( 30 mph for the velocity-impaired ) . The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed . I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch , about thirty feet away , heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road . I saw the dog , and before you could say SIPDE , he was on me . Boom ! I took the dog in the left leg , and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force , making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike , and cracking one panel . I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back , but my memory of this moment is hazy . I next turned around , and picked the most likely looking house . The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt ( cut mouth ) and hoped I was not hurt either . I could feel the pain in my shin , and expected a cool purple welt to form soon . Sadly , it has not . So I'm left with a tender shin , and no cool battle scars ! Interestingly , the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course . The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course , nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact . Delayed pain may have helped me here , as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember . What worries me about the accident is this : I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was . This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area , but I was riding around the speed limit . I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog , but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph . For that matter , how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end ? I eagerly await comment .

I believe that's a contradiction in terms . Unless you're really brave ( read : " reckless " ) a 500cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding . Getting more than that really is overkill , as you'll never even want to use it . The following bikes can be bought ( and repaired ! ) cheaply , are easy for a novice to manage , and are plenty high performance : Kawasaki EX - 500 Honda VF - 500 " Interceptor " Suzuki GS - 550E The 0-100 mph time of the EX - 500 at full throttle is " way sooner than you're ready for it " . :-) With something as small as a 250 , you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly ( unless it's a TZR or RGV :) . Now , I'm not saying that you're 100 % certain to kill yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR - 750 . Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine . What I am saying is that it's a waste of money , and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping .

Several years ago , while driving a cage , a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow down . However , a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier . Apparently , it was following the 1st dog . Henceforth , if a dog decides to cross the street , keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs . I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn ( not as good as Fiamms , but good enuff ) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards . I'd def feel more vulnerable on my ' 68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels . If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury .

Also , in most instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more performance . I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on . The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 2-3 K rpm . After talking to Kaz Yoshima , the developer and manufacturer of the slip on , he thinks I might need larger pilot , idle , jets . Was not suppose to but maybe where I live makes a difference . Altitude , barometric pressure ... Anyway , besides that minor glitch , I like the slip on performance and the sound , which is louder than stock , but not loud enough to annoy folks . The Ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full throttle . Just remember , every bike is a tuned system . When you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer , you may have to change other areas to compensate . Like a complete change of the exhaust system , header and muffler , changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing / pumping profile . Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike . Check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on . Also , as a last data point , in Sport Rider's first issue , did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR 600F2 . They also included , as a side bar , the Ontario slip on , the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel , 85 verses 91 . Buyer beware , of outrageous claimed increases in horse power ! It may have been true in the past , but not today !

If that's the " official line " taught in those rider education classes you were refering to , that also don't teach countersteering , I have to question the quality of the classes . The " official line " in MSF curricula is as I described . Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the front , as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift . The " official line " you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it . Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 , and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0 . > > Saying , " brake until the tire just begins to slide " is next to useless > > advice to a newbie .

" Chirping " the tire indicates impending lockup ( on most surfaces ) , and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking . I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider , but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used to use . > In any case , for maximum braking , if ( as I suggested ) you aim to keep > both wheels just on the point of sliding , then you'll be doing > exactly as * you * suggest ! ! True , but from the point of view of how to best * teach * riding skills ( which is how this discussion started ) , " keep both wheels just on the point of sliding " is nearly useless information .

Put two riders on identical machines . It's the one who knows what he's doing , and why , that will be faster .

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd ? Are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or decrease available traction ? Braking ? It is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques . For most of his riding life this may not be a problem , but in an emergency situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage . > But by including countersteering > theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right at > the time when there are * far * more important matters for them to learn . I disagree . The existance and immense success of riding courses which teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner that is neither confusing , nor detracts from any other aspects of the course . > And that was my original point .

An effort was made to remove the sticker . It came to pieces , leaving most of it firmly attached to the window . It was dark , and around 10:00 pm .

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means " slow down " . Seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , and you will make her experience much more enjoyable . Even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob , so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this . It's more work , but your passenger will appreciate it ! Also , I've found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops , which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on .

I'm not sure what the other guy ( can't track down his post for his name ) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable . They are . There's a space between each link where the " teeth " of the locking head notch in . Thus , each link is a possible locking point . Also , ( and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches ) the cobralinks " LOOK " a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks ( IMHO ) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at - cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally functional . Finally , I notice that when I ride with my leathers , harness boots , and the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier ( BTW , I've crashed in the rain dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae ) , cagers give me a much wider berth , don't hassle me , and tend to avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights .

I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it . Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road , I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible . I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference . One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while ( still with jacket ) you can just detach and stow the pants . One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women ( with standard suits ) . Supposedly for smaller women ( and petite men for that matter ) the 1 piece will fit better . Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them .

Bill , you are kidding yourself here . Firstly , motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that . Secondly , it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road , the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles , and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears .

However , 90 % + of the motorcyclists > I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience > as overwhelmingly positive . This regardless of the amount of experience > they brought into the course ( ranging from 10 minutes to 10 + years ) . Formal training in this country ( as far as I am aware ) does not include countersteering theory . I found out about countersteering about six years ago , from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist . I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left , but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing , and realized he was right ! It's an interesting bit of knowledge , and I've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it , who were at first as sceptical as I was . But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge , and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it , or that you can corner faster or better as a result , is absurd . Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely . But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right at the time when there are * far * more important matters for them to learn . And that was my original point . MikeFrom : Mark Crispin <mrc@Tomobiki-Cho.CAC.Washington.EDU> Subject : Re : BMW MOA members read this !

Suggestions ? An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front , but enough to manuver around it . Keep the bike in 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in ( how's that for engaged / disengaged ? ) , until there are two cars stopped behind you . When the next BDI cager comes screaching in , simply ride up along side of the car in front of you . You don't need to panic and do it , or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine . Do is smoothly , just rapidly .

My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons ... that's 50 mpg ! ! Surprisingly , the bike is a real cruiser . I was expecting something rough . She's a sweet backroad honey .

Rev it sitting still ( when the driveshaft is not moving ) and the bike twists a bit . Maybe I don't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect , but in my opinion a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence . Okay , here are my questions : 1 ) Any recommendations for a home-made fairing ? I'd like to keep the wind off my chest , and perhaps my helmet , for comfort at highway speeds ( 70 mph ) , yet don't want to ( a ) screw up the stability or ( b ) block my vision too much for trail riding . Anybody have luck with two-piece detachible fairings ? I'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas . 2 ) I run two lights , the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the crash bar . The illumination's excellent that way , with a full beam coming out from the level of the motor ( left side ); the lamp beam is linear so that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right , and it really picks up the periphery ( deer lurking , etc . ) Combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day . But I've heard that BMW alternators don't crank out too much . Do I need to shut down the sidelamp when I'm puttering around in the dirt at low RPM ? 3 ) This is embarassing : I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning .

I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs . But did the Hurt study make any distinction between an * ability * to swerve and a * failure * to swerve ? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen , riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare , simply because the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides everything else .

I purchased it via some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car . Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so , I purchased the charger . Believe it or not , the thing worked . The battery held a charge and energetically started the car , many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting . Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun wasn't strong enough due to its low angle . I think I paid $ 29 or $ 30 for the charger . There are more powerful , more expensive ones , but I purchased the cheapest one I could find .

I've only ever done it in an automatic . I was sitting in my Olds , in the winter , at a light , when I heard screeching behind me . I managed to dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was .

I don't > have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information : > > [ ... ] Any stories on how you all learned ? I'll tell you my story as an example of what * not * to do . Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T . He had taken the MSF beginner's course , so I actually learned * some * of what I needed to know to ride . I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $ 400 and a $ 12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker . Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet ( first smart move ) . Sometime around then I also passed my road test . On May 4 , 1984 , I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4 - mile trip . Entering the town where I lived ( a rather urban suburb ) , I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late , skidded the rear tire out , and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic . Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light , otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed . Now this is anecdotal evidence , to be sure , but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly . In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did . So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing . I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course , unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it . > 1 ) I only have about $ 1200-1300 to work with , so that would have > to cover everything ( bike , helmet , anything else that I'm too > ignorant to know I need to buy ) While you're waiting to take the course ( it might take a few weeks in DC , as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston ) , could you save up some more money to start out right ? Say $ 300 for riding gear , plus the cost bike , plus maybe $ 100 ( guess ) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe ( assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual ) , plus insurance , plus registration and licensing fees , plus the course , you're looking at maybe $ 600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance . > 2 ) What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance ? I turn 18 in > about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up > till now , and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a > motorcycle is going to insure ( I live in Washington DC if that makes > a difference ) I pay about $ 100 insurance now ( upstate NY ) but it was closer to $ 200 in Boston ( more urban ) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability , which you want unless you plan always to be poor . I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area , ergo more expensive . > 3 ) Any recommendations on what I should buy / where I should look for it ? There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines ; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available . You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available . ( My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead . ) Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street . I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted . Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms . Dealers in the Boston area , at least when I was shopping , were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models ( hence cheaper ) , although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales . - - David Karr ( karr@cs.cornell.edu ) - - ' 80 BMW R65 DoD #0969 also BMWMOA , NRA , ACLU , et al .From : rdc8@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu ( Robert D Castro ) Subject : LAW & ORDER & DoD Anyone catch the TV show Law & Order last night ( at least here in NYC ) ?

The specific recommandation cited in the Hurt study was that a formal " street strategy " , like SIPDE for example , was the most important component of any rider education curriculum .

This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride ( read : farther than around the block :-) . We'll be riding some twisty , fairly bumpy roads ( the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans ) . Communication : work out your own system . Or just slow down and holler back every once in a while . At reasonable speeds , even on my under-muffled Magna , we can hear each other . It's only above , say , 45 MPH that you can't really communicate . Balance : New passengers are a real pain , because you never know how they're going to react to steering . Some people catch on immediately and lean with me . Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing , and keep their bodies perpendicular to the horizon . This is a pain while turning , but manageable . The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to the horizon , then REMEMBER in the middle of a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the ` correct ' position . This always screws up the line I've picked out . Here's my personal checklist of things to tell passengers : - attire : helmet , long pants , boots / heavy shoes , jacket . - Keep feet on pegs at all times , unless I say otherwise . Do not get on / off unless I say you can . ( I've had people try to dismount in traffic , just as I'm pulling in to a parking space ! ) - Muffler gets HOT ! ( ' Nuff said ) - We get * GOOD * traction . We're not going to fall over . ( Many first-time riders are surprised by how tightly you can turn ! ) - Turn dynamics : sit so that you feel like you're sitting upright and we're going straight . Trust your butt , not your eyes - - if you're confused , close your eyes for a couple of turns to get the feel of it . Or just hug me tight . - Please , no sudden moves - - shift your weight as desired , but be gradual , so I can compensate . - Your faceplate is yours to open / close as desired . - Trust is essential . Trust the driver ( me ) to do the right thing - - I've driven many miles on this thing , and know how to operate it . Enjoy the ride . ( This is important to stress . For example , one of my first-time passwngers seemed to watch the speedo like a hawk : I drove her to the beach down 84 , and whever we topped 35 mph , she'd holler , " SLOW DOWN ! I'M SCARED " I humored her for a while , then simply covered the speedometer with the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck to the top of the cluster . Problem solved : she watched the scenery instead of the instruments , and had a much better time . Based on her experience driving a Lincoln Continental , she was unwilling to trust my ability to choose a safe speed for the bike . ) Usually I'll point out the controls , engine , transmission , brakes , tires , etc . and discuss motorcycle physics a bit too for first-timers . Helps calm their nerves , and gives the bike a chance to warm up . Watch out for gravel on the Mt . Hamilton road : there were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain ; by now , many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with a carpet of little , round , nearly invisible stones . It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on a blind corner , on the first trip ! Good luck - - have fun ! - - DON'T DRINK SOAP ! DILUTE DILUTE !

If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this , then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase , most noticeably in lower rpm range torque .

The idea would be to > design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics , and > see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of > us who have bikes are familiar . As you point out , the experiments would be difficult . But we know enough about the physics of the situation to do some calculations . There are in fact three effects contributing to leaning the bike over to begin a turn . 1 . Gyro effect causing a torque which twists the bike over . 2 . Contact patch having shifted to one side , causing bike to fall over . 3 . Contact patch being accelerated to the side , causing a torque which twists the bike over . Take an average bike / rider , average bike wheel , and at speeds of 5 , 15 , and 50 mph ( say ) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed to produce ( say ) 20 degrees of lean in ( say ) 2 seconds by each effect alone . My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant , and at high speeds 3 is dominant , and at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all , relatively speaking . By the way , a similar problem is this : how does a runner who wants to run round a corner get leaned into the corner fast ? Is there a running group where we could start " counter-footing " arguments and have them all falling over as they tried to work out how they go round corners ? - - Chris Malcolm cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh + 44 ( 0 ) 31 650 3085 Department of Artificial Intelligence , Edinburgh University 5 Forrest Hill , Edinburgh , EH1 2QL , UK DoD #205From : speedy@engr.latech.edu ( Speedy Mercer ) Subject : Re : Living In article <1993Apr05.172836.36759@rchland.ibm.com> pooder@rchland.vnet.ibm.com ( Don Fearn ) writes : > In article <05APR93.02451203.0049@UNBVM1.CSD.UNB.CA> , C70A000 <C70A@UNB.CA> writes : > | > > | > ...

If your distance calc is correct for an " on the road distance " ( and not as the crow flies ) , this is 900km a day for 5 days . If you spend the entire time on interstates , which would be a total waste of time , that's at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating / peeing / sight-seeing etc . I was contemplating a similar trip , but from Ottawa to LA , or maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx . I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it , I'd have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of time enjoying the country around me ; i . e . stopping with a camera , meeting towns-people , going to a few bars . No sense spending 2 weeks looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas pump .

Well , I used to get mad , and either try to communicate my anger to jerks , or to , uhm , educate them in how to improve their manners in traffic . Now I just try to get them off my tail . In heavy traffic I slow down a bit , mostly so I have more buffer zone in front to balance the minimal buffer behind , but I also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes , switch into one of them , and pass me - which is fine , because then I can keep a better eye on the jerk from behind , while looking ahead , rather than from in front , while splitting my attention between ahead and the mirrors . In traffic so heavy that there is no way for the jerk to pass , I might pull over , as if to look for a street number or name , ( still ignoring the jerk ) just to get the jerk off my tail . If this all sounds , well , wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic , or perhaps ( for any psych types ) passive-aggressive , consider that I prefer to get my adrenaline jollies from riding , rather than from yelling at jerks . A ride can improve my whole day , while yelling at a jerk is likely ( for me ) to ruin my ride or my day with my own anger . In the worst case , yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even a tiny jerk in a cage behind me is better armed ( with the cage ) than I am on a bike . On the other hand , you might try subtly arranging to be the last vehicle to legally cross one or more intersections , leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic ( and thus off your tail ) , or crossing illegally ( hopefully in front of the waiting police ) .

My regulator lasted over 100,000 miles , and didn't overcharge the battery . The wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though , tending to melt their insulation . I suspect they were underspecified ; it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air . Battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal .

Are there traditional 1 ) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension , adjust it to a stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves . 2 ) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are : a ) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down . Not when you stop at a STOP sign , not when she thinks you're gonna crash , never . Keep them on the pegs until you tell her to get off the bike . b ) She is to hold onto your waist . She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit . And ( added bonus for you here ) , she should keep as close to your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and knock your balls up onto the gas tank . You decide how best to word this . c ) Just stay perpendicular to the bike ; straight up in the seat . Don't lean your body into curves , just go with the bike and stay perpendicular . Don't look over your shoulder . * 3 ) Remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back . That means don't pop the clutch , and try to corner and stop smoother than usual . Be aware that if you jump on the brake , you're going to have the equivalent of a 100 lb . dead weight crashing into you from behind , so be prepared for that . 4 ) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have to go . No anti-women stuff here ; I have a tiny bladder myself . 5 ) Remind her to look around while you're riding . Point to things of interest . It makes the ride more enjoyable to her ( she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet ) , and it gives her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at . * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended " look over the rider's shoulder in curves " bit , and it just didn't work . The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable ( especially on the Maxim because , unlike the Ninja , the upright riding position really restricts the pillion's view of the road ahead ) . Next time I had her just remain perpendicular to the bike , and I could hardly tell there was someone else on the bike in curves , and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs . - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in the guise of public safety .

A traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime . That's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you want one , you are still innocent until proven guilty . Cops are not the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes , anyone who witnesses a crime can do so . Go to the Highway Patrol and explain the situation , give them a description of the car and the license number , and tell them the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute ( ie , search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy ) . Fill out the ticket and sign it . It will go through the same system any ticket a cop writes goes through . If contested , you will have to appear in court to prosecute .

The point of formal training must be to prepare riders for the road . Preparedness is in my opinion to know as much as possible . So , to exclude some aspects of riding a bike in a course is wrong IMHO . Now to countersteering in particular . Countersteering is something that must be trained . A common reaction among new bikers ( or bicycle riders ) in an emergency situation , is to steer the motorcycle like a bicycle . As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite to what was intended . Needless to say , this is dangerous . I have a specific example : A rider in a left turn . The rider thinks he / she is to close to the right shoulder of the road , and tries to steer the motorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right handle . The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road . A worse scenario : The same rider , same turn . In the middle of the turn the rider sees a truck coming towards him / her . The panicking rider tries to steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it . The main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency situations , AND what to do if in one . Thus , the knowledge ( and training ) of countersteering is IMHO a must in any riding course . - - staal@idt.unit.noFrom : fields@cis.ohio-state.edu ( jonathan david fields ) Subject : Question ? ? ?

Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel . > I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you > really in actuality avoid such an incident ? Suggestions ? The experience you describe is why I don't like to sit with my bike in gear - I figure there's a chance that I'll be startled in some way and stall my bike . And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time needed to put the bike in gear . So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers . I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the line . ( Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country ) If I can't split ( perhaps there isn't room ) then I will stop near one side of the lane so I have an easy escape , and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped . I watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure it will ! Whether I really would have time to move should a car fail to stop , I haven't had to find out yet . Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly , so it can be hard to tell if they are planning to brake or not ! So in summary , position yourself for an easy exit , and then watch your mirrors until it's all clear . - - Paul Thompson Apple ComputerFrom : moseley@u.washington.edu ( Steve L .

I learned when riding bareback as a kid to " palm-reign " , by just pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn left - a lot like countersteering . So that came pretty easy to me in the transition to motorcycles . It took a while however to break my habit of kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster . Steve ___ Steve L .

I have a 6 ' long CobraLinks lock that I used to use for my Harley ( she doesn't get out much anymore , so I don't use the lock that often anymore ) . It is made of 3/4 " articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable . It is probably enough to stop all the joyriders , but , unfortunately , professionals can open it rather easily : 1 ) Freeze a link . 2 ) Break frozen link with your favorite method ( hammers work well ) . 3 ) Snip through the steel cables ( which , I have on authority , are frightfully thin ) with a set of boltcutters . For the same money , you can get a Kryptonite cable lock , which is anywhere from 1/2 " to 7/8 " thick steel cable ( looks like steel rope ) , shielded in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish , and has a barrel-type locking mechanism . I don't know if it's adjustable , but my source says it's more difficult to pick than most locks , and the cable tends to squish flat in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear ( 5/8 " model ) . All bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel . Even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute . FYI , I'll be getting a Krypto cable next paycheck .

A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all . One thing to look for , BTW , is a soft front end .

This is from board member Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse . This is NOT my words , O . K . guys ? April 4 , 1993 re : Cecil King's Nominating Statement Dear Chick : We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year . Cecil King's nominating statement ( as it appeared in the Owners News ) is 968 words , nearly twice as many as that is permitted by the by-laws . In pertinent part , the rules state : " Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to a combined total of no more than 500 words . The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length . Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task . Had Cecil's statement been cut as required , it would have concluded approximately with the word " undertiding " [ sic ] in the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement . As a result , Cecil has obtained what I view as a grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president . This does not just taint the election for that office ; it makes a mockery of the process . I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election . Parenthetically , in your private correspondence with others , I would be most appreciative that when tou call me an " asshole " you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost guaranteed to have woeful consequences . With kind regards , I remain , Robert Higdon O . K .

Couple hours after > you " feel " sober ? What ? Or should I just work with " If I drink tonight , I > don't ride until tomorrow " ? This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago . While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage , I had the opportunity to listen to some of the " creative excuses " offered the judge by others . After listening to a number of " Well , I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up " versions , I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some . He was less than impressed with any of them . This young , rather burley looking guy , had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper . He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone . It was also noted that the defendant ( motorcycle rider ) had alcohol on his breath , but was not cited for this offence . The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice : " Well son , those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle . What do you have to say for your self ? " " Well Sir " , meekly the defenant replied , " I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home . " He offered nothing more or less . Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home . The judge moved by the simplicity of the response , fined him the maximum in this case ( plus court costs of course ) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school .

My solution was to buy a large helmet , and construct a removable liner from a sheet of . 5 " closed-cell foam and some satin ( glued to the inside surface ) . The result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with the liner in , and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out . Everyone else gets linered or not by best fit . - - - - - Michael Robinson UUCP : ucbvax ! cogsci ! robinson INTERNET : robinson@cogsci.berkeley.eduFrom : csundh30@ursa.calvin.edu ( Charles Sundheim ) Subject : Re : Why I wanted police officers to answer my posting viking@iastate.edu ( Dan Sorenson ) writes : > and copped <heh> an attitude when he was stopped ?

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs .From : mrc@Ikkoku-Kan.Panda.COM ( Mark Crispin ) Subject : dogs I'm a biker and a dog-lover . First and foremost , I want to mention some common sense . If it's a choice between injuring / killing a dog or getting yourself injured / killed , there is only one rational decision . Only the most insane animal rights kook would put the dog first . Second , it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language . How you react to a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game ( and that you're playing with him ) is completely different from how you react to a dog which has hostile intent . Third , it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog . Dogs are social beasts , and recognize a domination / submission hierarchy . To a dog , there are two types of fellow-creatures ; that which he dominates , and that which dominate him . You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the latter class . You are God : you are easily angered and your anger is terrible . But God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance , and may even on rare occasions dispense a kind word , a kind word , or even ( oh joy oh rapture unforeseen ) A Dog Bisquit ! Now , how does that all relate to biking ? Well , first , it's a good idea to assume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a game , and not out of overt hostility . The MSF suggestion is a very good one ; when you see the dog coming , slow down so he determines a particular place of interception . Just before you ( and he ) reach that spot , punch the throttle so that when he reaches it you're already long gone . Dogs take a few seconds to react to new input , and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a motorcycle is capable of . With a hostile dog , or one which you repeatedly encounter , stronger measures may be necessary . This is the face off . First - - and there is very important - - make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory . Face him off on the road , not on his driveway . If necessary , have a large stick , rolled up newspaper , etc . ( something the beast will understand is something that will hurt him ) . Stand your ground , then slowly advance . Your mental attitude is that you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT . The larger the dog , the greater your anger . Dogs will pick up anger , just as they can pick up fear . And , since you and he are not on his home territory , it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he is on your territory , and that you are prepared to fight to the death . Most dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory where there is at least a home advantage . They'll also observe that you are satisfied by that retreat ( gesture of submission ) and thus they have escaped punishment . The interesting thing about dogs is that body language communicates a great deal to them . The more effective you are at communicating body language , the less you actually have to do .

When it runs , it runs well . > Good point , did not catch this in the original post . The only other things which come to mind , since this is a gravity feed fuel system , is this . The fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the # 1 carburator . Let suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the vacuum valve in the fuel petcock . When it is cold , the hole is open enough to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on , since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas , and as the engine and surrounding area warm up , the hole seals up . One way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs . Connect a tube of the correct size , preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow , on the output side of the fuel petcock . Remove the control hose from # 1 carburator . Make sure the tank is full . Place the valve in the ON position and apply vacuum to the control hose , preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge , to check for air leaks . With vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely . To see if there is a vent problem , do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed , if it flows a lot faster with the filler cap open , then there may be something in the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog or partially clog the vent . I have heard of some F2 fuel tanks being replaced to fix this problem . So the things which might be defective are , the control hose from # 1 carb , the petcock valve , and possibly the fuel tank vent . Now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , then there is something in the carbs screwed up , but there are so many things to check , I would be typing all day to list them all ! Here are a few , with everything back together , apply vacuum to the petcock valve and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow . Open up the airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs , there are quite a few on each carb . I hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting . If American Honda does not resolve this , get MAD AS HELL and report them to the BBB and call the Honda Customer Service HOTLINE . It is a 800 number , but I don't recall it off the top of my head . I called just about tires for my F2 and a few days later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how I liked the support I received , here would be your chance to tell them what you think !

I just installed a MC Power Arc II , and it seems to run great . I also used MC coils , and neither the ignition module or the coils required any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 FXSTC . A little soldering and all was fine . Static timing was real easy to set too . On the other side of the coin , my local wrench , whose opinion I invariably seek but don't always adopt , thinks MC Power Arc is a " piece of shit " and says " all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day " . Needless to say , he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules , and recommends the Dyna-S system . I think that's the one with the Hall-effect timing sensor ( s ) , correct ?

Some pretty distorted thinking , I > should say . You seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these " lesser indiscretions " . If the towns-people aren't ruffled by the " indiscretions " and the partyers aren't either , maybe the " indiscretions " don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults . The only thing that really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans in the street , but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they helped set up the party in the first place . If I lived there and the bikers ' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation and good intentions , I'd certainly rather they stick around and party than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed . > Oh - - I'm sorry , I just noticed that you left mucho bucks ( as in MONEY ) ... > Nevermind my criticism , I was out of line .

Well , if you want to pick on Morgan , why not attack its ash ( wood ) frame or its hand-bent metal skin ( just try and get a replacement :-) ) .

That torque , and an upright riding position is better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm low torque motor . To a cruiser-motorcyclist , chrome has some importance . To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice . Unless motivated solely by price , these are the criteria each rider uses to select the vehicle of choice . To ignore these , as well as other criteria , would be insensitive . In other words , no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser rider may have . ( sometimes it's hard for * any * motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements ) You're fishing for flames , Dave .

Dog attack ! My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something . I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method : Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target , then take off and laugh at the dog , now far behind you . This time , it didn't work because I didn't have time . Riding up the hill leading to my house , I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel ( no relation to the Springer Softail , or the Springer Spagthorpe , a close relation to the Spagthorpe Viking ) . Actually , the dog encountered me with intent to harm . But I digress : I was riding near the ( unpainted ) centerline of the roughly 30 - foot wide road , doing between forty and sixty clicks ( 30 mph for the velocity-impaired ) . The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the left side of the road at an impossibly high speed . I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch , about thirty feet away , heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road . I saw the dog , and before you could say SIPDE , he was on me . Boom ! I took the dog in the left leg , and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force , making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike , and cracking one panel . I think I saw the dog spin around when I looked back , but my memory of this moment is hazy . I next turned around , and picked the most likely looking house . The apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt ( cut mouth ) and hoped I was not hurt either . I could feel the pain in my shin , and expected a cool purple welt to form soon . Sadly , it has not . So I'm left with a tender shin , and no cool battle scars ! Interestingly , the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course . The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course , nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some gut reaction to the sudden impact . Delayed pain may have helped me here , as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember . What worries me about the accident is this : I don't think I could have prevented it except by traveling much slower than I was . This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area , but I was riding around the speed limit . I worry about what would have happened if it had been a car instead of a dog , but I console myself with the thought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a blind driveway at 15-30 mph . For that matter , how many driveways are long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end ? I eagerly await comment .

I believe that's a contradiction in terms . Unless you're really brave ( read : " reckless " ) a 500cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding . Getting more than that really is overkill , as you'll never even want to use it . The following bikes can be bought ( and repaired ! ) cheaply , are easy for a novice to manage , and are plenty high performance : Kawasaki EX - 500 Honda VF - 500 " Interceptor " Suzuki GS - 550E The 0-100 mph time of the EX - 500 at full throttle is " way sooner than you're ready for it " . :-) With something as small as a 250 , you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly ( unless it's a TZR or RGV :) . Now , I'm not saying that you're 100 % certain to kill yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a GSXR - 750 . Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine . What I am saying is that it's a waste of money , and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping .

Several years ago , while driving a cage , a dog darted out at a quiet intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance between us so I didn't have to slow down . However , a 2nd dog suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and the force of the impact was enough to kill that Scottish Terrier . Apparently , it was following the 1st dog . Henceforth , if a dog decides to cross the street , keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs . I've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has a pretty loud OEM horn ( not as good as Fiamms , but good enuff ) but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards . I'd def feel more vulnerable on my ' 68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels . If there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to running over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the ground by said dog and dies from a head injury .

Thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences A friend of mine ( who's probably reading this right now ) just bought a new Yamaha Virago 750 . After spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening watching him struggle with the bolts ( had to remove the right peg , loosen the brake pedal , & c . & c . ) I've pretty much decided never to get this particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil / filter for me .

Also , in most instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more performance . I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on . The mid-range performance is better but I also notice a slight stumble at 2-3 K rpm . After talking to Kaz Yoshima , the developer and manufacturer of the slip on , he thinks I might need larger pilot , idle , jets . Was not suppose to but maybe where I live makes a difference . Altitude , barometric pressure ... Anyway , besides that minor glitch , I like the slip on performance and the sound , which is louder than stock , but not loud enough to annoy folks . The Ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full throttle . Just remember , every bike is a tuned system . When you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer , you may have to change other areas to compensate . Like a complete change of the exhaust system , header and muffler , changes the exhaust characteristic to the point which re-jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing / pumping profile . Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if they have used it on your particular bike . Check with people who have the system also to see what they think about there slip on . Also , as a last data point , in Sport Rider's first issue , did a review on a group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR 600F2 . They also included , as a side bar , the Ontario slip on , the Dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel , 85 verses 91 . Buyer beware , of outrageous claimed increases in horse power ! It may have been true in the past , but not today !

OK ( but I'm right ! ) : ^ ) > The official line here ( though I do have my doubts about it ) is that the > front brake is applied first , followed by the rear brake , the idea being > that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place . If that's the " official line " taught in those rider education classes you were refering to , that also don't teach countersteering , I have to question the quality of the classes . The " official line " in MSF curricula is as I described . Maximum braking is achieved by applying both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even and both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear to prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the front , as more traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to weight shift . The " official line " you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it . Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 , and is halving the available braking power by using only the front at time 0 . > > Saying , " brake until the tire just begins to slide " is next to useless > > advice to a newbie .

I'm not suggesting that you should always > aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the > limits of the machine , you have to go beyond them . Not necessarily true . " Chirping " the tire indicates impending lockup ( on most surfaces ) , and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate maximum braking . I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a better rider , but it is a manuver best saved for an experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used to use . > In any case , for maximum braking , if ( as I suggested ) you aim to keep > both wheels just on the point of sliding , then you'll be doing > exactly as * you * suggest ! ! True , but from the point of view of how to best * teach * riding skills ( which is how this discussion started ) , " keep both wheels just on the point of sliding " is nearly useless information .

Do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd ?

An effort was made to remove the sticker . It came to pieces , leaving most of it firmly attached to the window . It was dark , and around 10:00 pm . The sticker ( before being mangled in an ineffective attempt to be torn off ) warned the car would be towed if not removed . A " reasonable person " would arguably have driven the car .

My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means " slow down " . Seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , and you will make her experience much more enjoyable . Even a normal upshift causes your passenger to bob , so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch to eliminate this . It's more work , but your passenger will appreciate it ! Also , I've found that using more rear brake than normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops , which makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on . If you're going sport riding , have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you don't have to bear both your weights with your arms .

I'm not sure what the other guy ( can't track down his post for his name ) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable . They are . There's a space between each link where the " teeth " of the locking head notch in . Thus , each link is a possible locking point . Also , ( and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches ) the cobralinks " LOOK " a lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks ( IMHO ) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at - cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally functional .

But in regard to AeroStich it really depends on your particular size , shape and needs . If you upper and lower body are not proportional ( according to aero dimensions ) then it probably is going to be better mixing and matching the 2 piece suit . I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it . Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road , I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible . I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of a difference . One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and then want to walk around for a while ( still with jacket ) you can just detach and stow the pants . One thing to note is that Goldfine has problems getting a good fit for many women ( with standard suits ) . Supposedly for smaller women ( and petite men for that matter ) the 1 piece will fit better . Another recommendation is to pay for mods if you need them .

Bill , you are kidding yourself here . Firstly , motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that . Secondly , it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road , the suspension geometry and the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles , and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears . Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise ? ? > Mike , I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural > affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total > waste of time for you ( assuming your total " training " hasn't come from > simply from reading rec.motorcycles ) . However , 90 % + of the motorcyclists > I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience > as overwhelmingly positive . This regardless of the amount of experience > they brought into the course ( ranging from 10 minutes to 10 + years ) . Formal training in this country ( as far as I am aware ) does not include countersteering theory . I found out about countersteering about six years ago , from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist . I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left , but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing , and realized he was right ! It's an interesting bit of knowledge , and I've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it , who were at first as sceptical as I was . But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge , and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it , or that you can corner faster or better as a result , is absurd . Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely . But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right at the time when there are * far * more important matters for them to learn . And that was my original point . MikeFrom : Mark Crispin <mrc@Tomobiki-Cho.CAC.Washington.EDU> Subject : Re : BMW MOA members read this !

I've had it " tuned " and this doesn't : seem to help . I am thinking about new carbs or the injection system : from a GPz 1100 . Does anyone have any suggestions for a fix besides : restoring it to stock ? : New CARBS ? ? ? Why would that fix it ? you still have to get the jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition . You added a more free flowing exhaust , and then higher flowing filters . Chances are it's to lean . BUT ! This may not be , that's the big fun with carb tuning . It's _very_ tricky . Your one and only choice ( unless you want to spend many hours fiddling with the carbs ) is to take it to a guy witha Dyno and have he tune the carbs for your current set up .

Suggestions ? An even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and the car in front , but enough to manuver around it . Keep the bike in 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in ( how's that for engaged / disengaged ? ) , until there are two cars stopped behind you . When the next BDI cager comes screaching in , simply ride up along side of the car in front of you . You don't need to panic and do it , or you will pop the clutch and stall the engine . Do is smoothly , just rapidly . The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection than anything else ( particularly empty road ) . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with a biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | and I showed him a picture of you .

The battery held a charge and energetically started the car , many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just sitting . Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun wasn't strong enough due to its low angle . I think I paid $ 29 or $ 30 for the charger .

I've only ever done it in an automatic . I was sitting in my Olds , in the winter , at a light , when I heard screeching behind me . I managed to dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was . I've never had occasion to do it on a bike , but I imagine that it would be even easier , because you could slip beside the car in front . Giving a gander at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch out smoothly when you notice trouble , instead of waiting for the screeching .

I've never had problems and I know : numerous people that are still using the original battery in there : 8-10 year old beemers . THe original battery in an 8-10 year old BMW may be fine . Mine lasted many years . The replacement 30AH battery from BMW was a disaster . The mechanic from Comp . Acc . told me that CA would warantee replace the bad one with a new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have problems to bring it back and they'd do it again . It seems that many of those 30AH batteries were DOA , near-DOA , and always unlikely to be going strong by the end of the warantee period on them . THere was a big batch of bad ones , and they replaced them with - you guessed it - more bad ones . BMW switched to a 25AH battery that has more cold cranking amps , even if it has less total juice . I switched to a YUASA that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one third fewer dollars .

I don't > have my bike yet so I need a few pieces of information : > > [ ... ] Any stories on how you all learned ? I'll tell you my story as an example of what * not * to do . Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T . He had taken the MSF beginner's course , so I actually learned * some * of what I needed to know to ride . I proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $ 400 and a $ 12 helmet and rode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker . Then I decided to invest in a full-face helmet ( first smart move ) . Sometime around then I also passed my road test . On May 4 , 1984 , I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a 4 - mile trip . Entering the town where I lived ( a rather urban suburb ) , I had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late , skidded the rear tire out , and was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic . Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light , otherwise I might have slid under a car and been killed . Now this is anecdotal evidence , to be sure , but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly . In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff as I did . So my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing . I wouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course , unless you happen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready to use it . > 1 ) I only have about $ 1200-1300 to work with , so that would have > to cover everything ( bike , helmet , anything else that I'm too > ignorant to know I need to buy ) While you're waiting to take the course ( it might take a few weeks in DC , as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston ) , could you save up some more money to start out right ? Say $ 300 for riding gear , plus the cost bike , plus maybe $ 100 ( guess ) to a mechanic to make sure the machine is safe ( assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up machine from a private individual ) , plus insurance , plus registration and licensing fees , plus the course , you're looking at maybe $ 600 not including the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance . > 2 ) What is buying a bike going to do to my insurance ? I turn 18 in > about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up > till now , and I need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a > motorcycle is going to insure ( I live in Washington DC if that makes > a difference ) I pay about $ 100 insurance now ( upstate NY ) but it was closer to $ 200 in Boston ( more urban ) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability , which you want unless you plan always to be poor . I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area , ergo more expensive . > 3 ) Any recommendations on what I should buy / where I should look for it ? There used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines ; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available . You could probably look through past issues to size up what used bikes might be available . ( My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice instead . ) Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street . I basically settled on my present bike by noticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the way I wanted . Nothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms . Dealers in the Boston area , at least when I was shopping , were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models ( hence cheaper ) , although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales . - - David Karr ( karr@cs.cornell.edu ) - - ' 80 BMW R65 DoD #0969 also BMWMOA , NRA , ACLU , et al .From : rdc8@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu ( Robert D Castro ) Subject : LAW & ORDER & DoD Anyone catch the TV show Law & Order last night ( at least here in NYC ) ?
