The Japanese spacecraft , Hiten , crashed on the Moon last weekend . For the past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere . It was placed in lunar orbit in February 1992 , and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon . ___ ___ ___ / _ / | / ___ / \ / _ / | Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ / | | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___ | | | | | __ ) | / | | | __ M / S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand / ___ | | | | ___ / | | / __ / | Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and | ___ | / | _ | / | ___ | / | part vegetable .From : jennise@opus.dgi.com ( Milady Printcap the goddess of peripherals ) Subject : Looking for a little research help [ addendum ] Sorry but I forgot this ps .

I don't know what a " low grade " fusion reactor is , but the major problem with 3He ( aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work ) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small - - on the order of 5 ppb or so , on average ( more in some fractions , but still very small ) . Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed . This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth . As I recall , Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium ( at . 5 % in the Earth's crust , average ) would not run out , and touted lunar mines , even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $ . 06 / pound . This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources . On the moon , titanium occurs in basalts ; " high-Ti " basalts ( Apollo 11 and 17 ) have 8-14 % titanium dioxide ( by weight ) . This is nice , but ... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium . They very often have 3 % TiO 2 , frequently have 4 % , and sometimes even 5 % TiO 2 ( again , by weight ) . These flood basalts are * enormous * - - millions of cubic kilometers , scattered all over the world ( Siberia , Brazil , the NW United States , Ethiopia , etc . ) . If even 1 % of the basalts are 5 % TiO 2 , this is trillions of tons of TiO 2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts . It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore ( never mind the richer , but less common , terrestrial ores being mined today ) .

Currently , mining companies can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices - - something like $ 50 ! The mining lobby has for decades managed to block any reform of these outdated fees . In fact , the latest attempt to reform them was again blocked - - President Clinton " compromised " by taking the mining fee reforms out of his ' 94 budget , and plans to draft separate legislation to fight that battle .

If I read you right , you're saying in essence that , with a larger economy , nations will have more discretionary funds to * waste * on a lunar facility . That was certainly partially the case with Apollo , but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military , scientific , or commercial reason for being rather than just a " we have the money , why not ? " approach . It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose , it's possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose , but it's most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least . Therefore , Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases . Can you put a 200 person base on the Moon for $ 30 million a year ?

With two detectors , one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky . With three detectors , one gets intersecting annuli , giving two possible locations . If one of these locations is impossible ( because , say , the Earth blocked that part of the sky ) , voila , you have an error box . BATSE , by having 8 detectors of its own , can do its own location determination , but only to within about 3 degrees ( would someone at GSFC , like David , like to comment on the current state of location determination ? ) . Having inde - pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty . You did touch on something that you didn't mean to , though . Some believe ( in a reference that I have somewhere ) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector . It would be a mean , nasty God , though , that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10 ^ 12 Gauss neutron star ... but this is getting too far afield .

Especially given the Net's strong interest in vaporware spacecraft ... = = = The Dream Machines : An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art , Science , and Literature By Ron Miller with Foreword by Arthur C . Clarke Krieger Publishing Company Melbourne , Florida , USA Orig . Ed . 1993 Pre-publication $ 84.50 ISBN 0-89464- 039-9 This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon . The idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century . The need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years . As soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one , human beings wanted to reach them . Tracing the history of the many imaginative , and often prescient , attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology , science , astronomy , and engineering . Once space travel became feasible , there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board - - or off the ground , for that matter . These also are described in theis book , for the same reason as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are : they are all accurate reflections of their particular era's dreams , abilities , and knowledge . Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500 , as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel , is listed chronologically . The chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures . They also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries . They reveal connections , influences , and evolutions hitherto unsuspected . Every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration . Nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing . This allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss , to visualize differences , similarities , and influences . This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history , and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams . Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating . The unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship . SPECIAL FEATURES Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft , both real and fictional Contains scores of illustrations : artwork , drawings , and photos contemporary with the subject . This includes extremely rare illustrations from scarce books and novels , exclusive photos and drawings fromSoviet spacecraft ; rare stills from both famous and obscure science fiction films , and unpublished photographs from NASA archives An index , bibliography , and appendices are included .

SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY " On Monday , March 15 at noon , Quest Aerospace Education , Inc . launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria . The first rocket was launched by Dr . Bill Gaubatz , director and SSTO program manager , and the second by Air Force Captain Ed Spalding , who with Staff Sgt . Don Gisburne represents Air Force Space Command , which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for potential military operational use . Both rocket launches were successful . The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria and Building 11 , and the second landed on the roof of the cafeteria . Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the McDonnell Douglas DC-X . The 1/122 nd semi-scale model of the McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude of 300 feet . The Space Clippers can be used in educational settings to teach mathematics and science , as well as social studies and other applications .

ASUKA ( ASTRO-D ) - ISAS ( Japan ) X-ray astronomy satellite , launched into Earth orbit on 2/20 / 93 . Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength ( 1-20 Angstrom ) X-ray telescope , X-ray CCD cameras , and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters . CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe . Cassini is a joint NASA / ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe . Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV / Centaur in October of 1997 . After gravity assists of Venus , Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory , the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004 . Upon arrival , the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn . Near the end of this initial orbit , the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan . The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface . After the completion of the Probe mission , the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years . Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus , Dione and Enceladus . The objectives of the mission are threefold : conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere , rings and magnetosphere ; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's satellites , and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface . One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere . These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface . The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface . Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere . The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini ( 1625-1712 ) , the first director of the Paris Observatory , who discovered several of Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings . The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens ( 1629-1695 ) , who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturn's rings .

The primary objective of the TOPEX / POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years , substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics . The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean . ULYSSES - European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles . Launched in late 1990 , it carries particles-and-fields experiments ( such as magnetometer , ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges , plasma wave radio receivers , etc . ) but no camera . Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane , it went to Jupiter instead , and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992 . This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic . It will pass over the Sun's south pole in the summer of 1993 . Its aphelion is 5.2 AU , and , surprisingly , its perihelion is about 1.5 AU - - that's right , a solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is ! While in Jupiter's neigborhood , Ulysses studied the magnetic and radiation environment . For a short summary of these results , see * Science * , V . 257 , p . 1487-1489 ( 11 September 1992 ) .

I feel compelled to complain : the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is utterly false , even though it is popular enough to make it to BATSE press releases . The idea behind the statement is as follows : " if you smack two neutron stars together , or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole , a lot of energy is released , enough for a gamma-ray burst at a cosmological distance . But , so the reasoning continues , this energy is released below a lot of matter , so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum . The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal , so this model must be wrong . " As so often , the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model . It may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray burst , but the ' fireball ' of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow . When this slams into the surrounding medium , a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results , which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy . All this is not my idea : it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees , Peter Meszaros ( sorry for the missing accents :-) and co-workers . It is certainly not a complete model , but it may well be the best one around ( summing over all proposed distance scales ) . An alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball , by the way , is the so-called ' failed supernovae ' scenario by Stan Woosley , in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole . If the stellar core was rotating , part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force , and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole . This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis , which again constitutes relativistic flow . The rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers , but the flux may be more strongly beamed , so that the net rate of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two scenarios , but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario . On another note : I do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths , or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes . Theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work , and therefore it * must * be so-and-so .

Well , here goes . The first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind . I mean compared to football and baseball , the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested or even curious about spaceflight . I think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education . All of us , in our own way , can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world . The document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space . I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld ( i . e . the spacecraft ) . Only through the careful analyses of engineering , chemical , biological , and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight . So , I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight . Such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs . In essence , we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies .

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost , and you don't want to clip off the panels each time .

An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics .

Radio Atmospheric Science Center . In International Council of Scientific Unions , Middle Atmosphere Program . Handbook for MAP , Vol . 20 5 p Publication Date : Jun . 1986 As the first attempt among MST ( mesosphere stratosphere troposphere ) type radars , the MU ( middle and upper atmosphere ) radar features an active phased array system . Unlike the conventional large VHF radars , in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements , each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element . This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays , because phase shift and signal division / combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network . The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg . Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system , careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out . Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system . An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA ( EXOS-C ) . A receiver named MUM ( MU radar antenna Monitor ) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar . The principle of the measurement and results are discussed .

A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan . The radar will be built in Pontianak , West Kalimantan , Indonesia ( 0.03 deg N , 109.29 deg E ) . The system is a 47 - MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan , which has been in successful operation since 1983 . It will have a PA product of about 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m ( P = average transmitter power , A = effective antenna aperture ) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of the MU radar . This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 20 deg from the zenith . As is the case of the MU radar , a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller .

It was a bit shorter than I expected . Last year ( when the stock was first down ) , they made a big presentation on the 777 , and other programs . This year , it was much more bare-bones . In any case , I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear , and so I got there early , and figured that If I didn't get to the mike , maybe they would read mine off of a card , and so I wrote it down , and handed it in . After the meeting started , Mr . Shrontz said that he would only answer written questions , in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs . Naturally , I was crushed . So , when question and answer time came , I was suprised to find my question being read and answered . Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took . Presumably getting there early , and getting the question in early made all the difference . So , on to the substance . The question was Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport , such as a commercial space launch system , and if not , how will Boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by Mcdonnell Douglass ? Well , he read it without a hitch , and without editing , with impressed me , then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question , last part first . This is to the best of my recollection what he said . As far as single stage to orbit technology , we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach , and we are talking to some of our customers about that . As far as commercialization , that is a long ways off . The High speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point . So , this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial arena , and for the most part this is true , however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own . Now , I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing . Actually , this is a mis-nomer , as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing , however , he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts . He won't tell me what he is doing , but maybe this is where the TSTO action is taking place at boeing .

My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses , sitting very close to Jupiter , play any role whatsoever in the problem . Or , to put it more technically , the extra " volume " they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible . Jupiter is 2E27 kg , while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23 . Also , as I said , the few references that I've looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes . The important thing is a Jupiter-Sun-comet " reverse slingshot " that leads to a weakly Jupiter-bound orbit for the comet ( at least a temporary one ) .

What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 ( Martin Mariatta , Boeing , Mcdonell Douglas , General Dynamics , Lockheed , Rockwell ) getting together , and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles , and spending say $ 3million to do that . Recognizing that most of the military requirements for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere ( say , has the shuttle ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability ? You get the idea , figure out how many , how often , where to , etc ... ) Then taking this data , and forming a sematech type company ( bad example , I know ... but at least its an example ... ) To develop between 3 and 5 craft designs . Then to take all of those designs , and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are , and demonstrate those technologies , in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today . And lets say that this portion again funded by the GOV cost about $ 20 million . And from here all of these companies went their separate ways , with the intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall street , and saying " I want to build this vehicle , and here are the numbers that show % 20 ROI , fund me ... ) Now many of you think that this is a joke , but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background . It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled ( NASP , NLS , ALS , DCY ? , etc ... ) They need to work more in the japaneese , and european spirit of initial cooperation . They have also learned that design requirements that are phony ( I . E . some generals idea of what a space vehicle ought to be ) ends up getting chopped up in congress , because it is not a REAL requirement . Any feedback ?

The differential arrival time techinique requires interplanetary baselines to get good positions . The differential arrival at the eight detectors differ by 10 ' s of nanoseconds . This is smaller than BATSE's microsecond timing capabilities . BATSE , Ulysses , and Mars Obsverver are used for this technique . Each BATSE detector does not have a full sky field of view . The sensitivity of each detector decreases with increasing angle of incidence . The burst position on the sky is determined by comparing the count rates in different detectors . PatFrom : jkatz@access.digex.com ( Jordan Katz ) Subject : U . S . Space Foundation Speech Speech by Pete Worden Delivered Before the U . S . Space Foundation Conference Colorado Springs , Colorado April 15 , 1993 What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble . For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U . S . Space Foundation . My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT . By I intend to speak of more . How to lower the cost and make rapid progress . SSRT is to my mind - - and I hope to convince you - - the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space - - Faster , Cheaper , and Better . Faster , Cheaper , Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another . It is a new thing to be sure - - but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters . When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago , so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics - - it made no sense . For example , Dr . Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp . , said of SSRT in the L . A . Times that it , " defies the best principles of launching payloads into space . " Well Dr . Rachtin - - you've made us mad ! What are these principles that SSRT defies ? Well I'll tell you . It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware . It violates the " fact " that it takes 20 years to build something new . And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars . It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new / old lessons . Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn V . General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to demonstrate . And the X - 1 airplane didn't cost $ 1 billion . It took one of the great engineers of the 1950 ' s to remind us of these truths - - Max Hunter . Max , to remind you , was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program , and old faster , better , cheaper success story . Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960 ' s . Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little , Test a little . Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration . We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements - - they'd just change every few years anyway . [ not included in the speech - - The ALS / NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as " Shape Shifter " than " Space Lifter . " We didn't spend a lot money - - this X-Rocket only cost $ 60 million . When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that ? And it didn't take a lot of time to build - - McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months . Finally , the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major - - motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule . As I described what SSRT is - - and isn't keep in mind its only a first step . There are several more steps - - and steps that can easily fail - - before the U . S . can field an SSTO . But each step should follow the same principles - - a small management team - - a few years technology demonstration - - and a modest budget . Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve : ( See charts ) I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation - - the giants of the last great space era , the 1950 ' s and 1960 ' s . They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight . They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth ! But we do have an answer . We can follow their build a little , test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space . I know there are nay sayers among you - - those who say SSRT is a stunt . It needs more thermal protection , the engines are wrong , it would be better to land horizontally , etc , etc . I say to you - - we'll see you at White Sands in June . You bring your view-graphs , and I'll bring my rocketship . If we do what we say we can do , then you let us do the next step . [ not included in the speech : If we fail - - you still have your program offices , staff summary sheets , requirement analyses , and decade long programs . ] I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea - - Any Takers ?From : Lawrence Curcio <lc2b+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject : Re : Big amateur rockets Let's see . These aren't , in a strict sense , amateur rockets . That term denotes rockets , the engines of which are constructed by the user . The rockets you describe are called HPR , or high power rockets , to distinguish them from ( smaller ) model rockets . They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles . The engines are classified by impulse . A " D " engine , for example , can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse . An " F " engine can have no more than 40 ns . Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse . So far , engines up to size " O " are available pretty much off the shelf . Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives , and as such are controlled . Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives , and are not as controlled . Class F engines , BTW , are not HPR engines , but model rocket engines . ( Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo . ) There is an HPR Society , The Tripoli Rocket Society , I believe , which holds events at various sites throughout the year , with all legalities ( FAA waiver included ) taken care of . The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H , though it is involved in HPR as well . These societies certify users of HPR rockets , and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals . Bottom Line : It's legit .

It may be that they just didn't mention it , or that they actually haven't thought about it . I got the vague impression from their mission proposal that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing . They seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without explaining why , or what they would do once they got there .

I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere > evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet . The question > is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions . This is a good question . There are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable . For example , why does the earth's atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does ? The naive answer is " photosynthesis " , but this is clearly incomplete . Photosynthesis by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated , as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten . What is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material . On earth , this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter , mostly from oceanic sources . However , this burial requires continental sediments ( in the deep ocean , the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered ) . This suggests that a planet without large oceans , or a planet without continents undergoing weathering , will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere . In particular , an all-ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere . There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time , for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment . No convincing feedback mechanism has been identified . Perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle : if during the last 500 MYr or so , the oxygen level had dropped too low , we wouldn't be here to be wondering about it . Paul F .

I think this is a little inaccurate , based on Feynman's account of the software-development process * before * the standdown . Fred is basically correct : no sophisticated tools , just a lot of effort and painstaking care . But they got this one right * before * Challenger ; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people . ( He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners , but hadn't had to give in to it much yet . ) Among other things , the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations , and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure . As a result , the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand , and the number of in-flight failures was zero . As Fred mentioned elsewhere , this applies only to the flight software . Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters , and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care .

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity . For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth , you need a delta-v of 2.5 km / s . Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce , a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel + oxidizer . A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot ( depending on the nature of the structure ) would be the payload . I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community . It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics ' . Or , it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here : $ 1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon , $ 1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore / CCD burner . I wouldpledge $ 1000 for the first person to bring it down , and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers , nature lovers , or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise . Of course , a Gerald Bull solution might be simpler . ( Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use of a large caliber gun ; or the solution which was applied to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun . ) - - David M .

When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS - 56 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB . The tool survived the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot altitude , then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC . NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media , " It's been a long time since something like this happened . We've lost washers and bolts ( before ) but never a tool like this . " The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a Thiokol Corp . technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on April 2nd . Unfortunately , the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its " extra payload " . NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date . The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician . When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster , its 18 - inch long rope was still attached . The pliers were found in a part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad . | ( Ron's ed . note : naaahhh , just too easy ) A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that the Shuttle processor will take " appropriate action " .

Box 605 Amherst , NY 14226-0605 COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula , based on studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests . ( 1/3 . 4 ) D = S S c K W : crater diameter in km g p f n ( 1/6 ) S = ( g / g ) : gravity correction factor for bodies other than g e t Earth , where g = 9.8 m / s ^ 2 and g is the surface e t gravity of the target body . This scaling is cited for lunar craters and may hold true for other bodies . ( 1/3 . 4 ) S = ( p / p ) : correction factor for target density p , p a t t p = 1.8 g / cm ^ 3 for alluvium at the Jangle U a crater site , p = 2.6 g / cm ^ 3 for average rock on the continental shields . C : crater collapse factor , 1 for craters < = 3 km in diameter , 1.3 for larger craters ( on Earth ) . ( 1/3 . 4 ) K : . 074 km / ( kT TNT equivalent ) n empirically determined from the Jangle U nuclear test crater . 3 2 19 W = pi * d * delta * V / ( 12 * 4.185 * 10 ) : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent given diameter d , velocity v , and projectile density delta in CGS units . delta of around 3 g / cm ^ 3 is fairly good for an asteroid . An RMS velocity of V = 20 km / sec may be used for Earth-crossing asteroids . Under these assumptions , the body which created the Barringer Meteor Crater in Arizona ( 1.13 km diameter ) would have been about 40 meters in diameter . More generally , one can use ( after Gehrels , 1985 ): Asteroid Number of objects Impact probability Impact energy diameter ( km ) ( impacts / year ) ( * 5 * 10 ^ 20 ergs ) 10 10 10 ^ - 8 10 ^ 9 1 1 000 10 ^ - 6 10 ^ 6 0.1 100 000 10 ^ - 4 10 ^ 3 assuming simple scaling laws . Note that 5 * 10 ^ 20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT equivalent , or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb . References : Gehrels , T . 1985 Asteroids and comets . _Physics Today _ 38 , 32-41 .

NEXT : FAQ # 5/15 - References on specific areasFrom : Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org Subject : Space Advertising ( 1 of 2 ) Brian Yamauchi asks : [ Regarding orbital billboards ... ] > And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN > news blip ? How serious is this project ? Is this just in the " wild > idea " stage or does it have real funding ? Well , I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News / Space Technology Investor ... To summarize : SPACE ADVERTISING First , advertising on space vehicles is not new - - it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle . For example , the latest GPS launcher had the ( very prominent ) logos on its side of - McDonnell Douglas ( the Delta launcher ) - Rockwell International ( who built the GPS satellite ) - USAF ( who paid for the satellite and launch ) , and - the GPS / Navstar program office This has not been considered " paid advertising " but rather " public relations " , since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side , and there was no money exchanged for this . [ However , putting a 10 ' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is " advertising " as much as it is " public relations " , in my opinion . ] [ And by the way , I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side ... ] There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising , or placing large advertising signs in orbit . On the shuttle , for example , I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980 ' s which looked at putting logos on the external tank , or on the sides of the payload bay . These ventures would be different than " public relations " , in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight , and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization . ( For example , painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can , or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it . ) ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990 , when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch . ( An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers , I remember . ) Similarly , Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games , and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations . Mars candy bars , for example , got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir . Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles . The upcoming Conestoga launch ( in June ) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side , for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie " The Last Action Hero " . Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations , Columbia pictures has paid $ 500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket , its booster rockets , and on the COMET payload , which will orbit the Earth for one month . A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago . ( As a side note : Robert Lorsch , an advertising executive , is talking about suing NASA . He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program . Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET , NASA violated an agreement that it " would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation . " This is being disputed , since the launch is a " commercial launch " and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues , but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA . ) ORBITAL " BILLBOARDS " Orbital " billboards " have been the staple of science fiction for some time . Arthur C . Clarke wrote about one example , and Robert Heinlein described another in " The Man Who Sold the Moon " . Several different potential projects have been developed , although none have been implemented , but the most real prior to 1993 being the " Eiffel II " project , which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial .

As published in " US Industrial Outlook 1993 " ( which was released in January ) , revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $ 4,890 M . In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates , this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry , where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $ 1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993 . The US Industrial Outlook also projects U . S . commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year , and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $ 450 M , future sales will be " adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans . " Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries , revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $ 1,900 M , primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks . Similarly , remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $ 250 M in 1993 ( up 15 % ) .

In general , not a bad report - - with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area . There , changes of only a few satellites worth $ 100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection . If we look forward over several years , this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business . Furthermore , sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data , expected to be released about mid - year . Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales ( including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals ) appears to be missing from the January data set . DoC usually publishes a listing of " Space Business Indicators " in mid-year , and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then . I expect the revised revenues should easily top $ 5,000 M , if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers , and the year should show about a 10 % overall market growth . Looking beyond this year's data , future markets look quite promising . The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $ 3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned , and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990 ' s . My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth , but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years . ( My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services . I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes , nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected . ) It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities . The $ 60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module , planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle , but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module . ] 2 - DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS McDonnell Douglas Corporation , which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts . Motorola Inc . announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66 - satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation , and in mid April , McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract . The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites . Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches . These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time , providing for at least 9 launches . Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation , such as a planned on-orbit spares , may also be launched on Delta . Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation , and not yet final . The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC , bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher . This contract is only initially worth $ 7.5 million , but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches , encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002 . These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites , plus other programs . First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year , after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years . Under this contract the USAF can also request " launch on demand " services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period , with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request . [ Commentary : If these two contracts are fulfilled , they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century . Combined , these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches , worth about $ 2,200 M to MDC , and sustaining a core business base of $ 300-400 M / year . Other contracts for international and commercial payloads , as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads , will add to this business base - - keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company . However , it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts . Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U . S . , nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture . Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches . But , hopefully , these uncertainties will be settled this year . Similarly , the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS / " Spacelifter " program . At this time , while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed , future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews . Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all " ELV upgrade " programs ( including the MLV programs ) in favor of the proposed " Spacelifter " program . Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations , particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget . ] 3 - COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC " GO-AHEAD " The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce . A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland , California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth . [ Commentary : There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC , other than the announcement of the operating and construction license . This was reported to be at the request of WorldView . Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a " Star Wars " spinoff , using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data , and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing / GIS users . Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists , agricultural planners , and urban planners . It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act . The Act , as passed last November , provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices . Prior to this act , remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices , and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices . There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development . I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so . In contrast to these large , government-sponsored remote sensing systems , smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology , and I believe , can find profitability on the margin . I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so . ] 4 - INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ " STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT " Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker , despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches . In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said " We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95 % - plus success rate , this will become a highly profitable , cash - generating unit . " Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management , Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $ 70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $ 100 M per year by 2000 . This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market . [ Commentary : Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division . Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses , many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold . The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker , despite current problems - - if they can get their act together . Sales are projected to be about $ 560 M in 1993 , which will probably generate a loss of about $ 25 M . If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market , and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers , then they could generate healthy profits from those sales . But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track , this division will continue to show substantial losses . In response to the sell-off rumors , in my opinion , this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability . To do such a takeover , the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm . In GD SSD's case , to get the division back on track , the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur , as well as in selling Atlas services . This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house , and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services . Optimally , the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience , and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well . Candidates for this might be TRW , Rockwell , Lockheed , and Martin , and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing . But most of those firms have cash flow problems ( MDC ) , have had a substantial business contraction ( Boeing and MDC ) , are involved with other launch firms ( Lockheed ) , or have taken on substantial debt ( Martin ) . And coming up with the $ 700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company . ] 5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND Arianespace , the operator of the Ariane launch system , is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990 ' s . In early February , Arianespace released their annual market survey , which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade . Over short run , Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market . Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995 , Ariane holds contracts for 31 , General Dynamics ' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts , McDonnell Douglas ' Delta holds 7 , and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts . Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25 % split between weather , Earth observation , and scientific satellites . Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia / Pacific region . Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue , with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders . Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level , to about 3000 kg in GEO . Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years , but in the second half of the decade , Arianespace predicts demand will decrease . Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply , particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders . One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles , including Russian launch systems . But Arianespace predicts that in the long term , investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price , and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality , and their market penetration will be minimal . [ Commentary : Ariane releases their market surveys annually , and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN / STI . Comparing the two surveys , there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers . The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques , reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit . I note that in contrast to some predictions , demand for space - based communications transponders appears to be remain strong . While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets , growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to - multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand . Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service , but only from established point A to established point B . To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points , and while there are improved network solutions , installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars . For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure , satellites still offer the most cost effective solution . And if new services are required into a new region , it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network . This allows rapid growth of new satellite services , and has kept demand high . The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well , since as demand grows between the points serviced , it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic . Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly , satellite market projections remain rosy . But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes . Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more , in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites . This has cut back some of the launch demand , as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals . And as last note ; Arianespace didn't flag it this year , but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over - supplied by existing launch systems in the near term . The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year . From the supply side , Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year , Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year , Atlas is capable of 6-12 , Long March 4-8 , Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4 , Russia's Proton capable of 8 , and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year . That's a lot of capability for a small market . We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches . ] 6 - NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules . A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules . In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown , one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed . Such a failure typically scrubs a launch , and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island , VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch . Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels , and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call . Fortunately , the Pegasus functioned as expected , and the abort command receiver was not needed . But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules , and was not obeyed . Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) with support from NASA , OSC , and the Air Force . This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch . According to the NTSB , their investigation will take about 6 months , and is primarily looking at lines of authority , communications links and safety procedures used in the launch . [ Commentary : This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch . Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation , who had licensed the commercial launch . At the time of writing this column , some of the initial investigations have been concluded , and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press . Apparently , 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test . After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding , the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch . According to the mission rules , this should have stopped the launch . Somehow , the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed , and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B - 52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch . Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed - - with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team , and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch . As we see more and more commercial launches , more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved . This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem ( as they do with commercial aircraft problems ) . I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications , and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated . ] 7 - ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system , based upon converted ICBM components . Two versions of the launcher are being marketed : the " Aerokosmos " winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus , and the " Severkosmos " , launched from a mobile ground transporter . The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit , and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km . Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called ' Sineva ' . Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment , focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system , They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad , outside of Moscow . [ Commentary : There's very little released information on this new venture . My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems . It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union . This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs , but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing . ] 8 - GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING In late January , Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County , Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast . The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site , stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns , plus environmental and other geographic considerations . However , the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses , and recommended other potential uses . [ Commentary : This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site . While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans , Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant , and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in , then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development . This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site . These include : - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs ? - Is there a market advantage of using the site ? - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site ? - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment ? Other commercial launch site ventures - - including those at Woomera , Poker Flat , Cape York , White Sands , Alabama Off-Shore Platform , Hawaii , and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria . In my opinion , some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation , and not on sound financial grounds . ] 9 - SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING In one of his last official acts , former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms . One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster . With that regulatory impediment removed , the 3 - stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year , planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period . The Capricornia is described as a small 3 - stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO . Several launch sites are being examined for the system , including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands . Originated by INTA in Spain , the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding , and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US . [ Commentary : Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market . Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US / Italian Scout launcher . However , Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited , and the Scout program is being phased out ( accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system ) . This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system . Surprisingly enough , ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure . Studies have been performed by British Aerospace , Aerospatiale , Deutsche Aerospace , and Italian organizations , but with the exception of the Swedish / PacAstro system ( reported below ) , I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware . Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher . There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher / IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970 ' s and early 1980 ' s . What is known is in Feb 1992 , the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency ( Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE ) . The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983 , expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms . The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid - 1980 ' s . Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested , but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system . It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994 . The US $ 9 M , 181 Kg , SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US . No launch vehicle has yet been selected , but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract . ] 10 - PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP PacAstro , a small launch firm in Herndon , Virginia announced in late February it had received a $ 6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA - 2 launch vehicle . This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service ( PSS ) , a joint Norwegian Space Center / Swedish Space Corp . program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions . According to PacAstro , PSS is also performing an $ 8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities , including a new integration facility and a fully - enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA - 2 . PacAstro has been chosen as " the main alternative rocket supplier " for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya . The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified . [ Commentary : PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now . The PA - 2 is a small , two stage rocket fueled by RP - 1 and Liquid Oxygen . From PacAstro's literature , the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of " off the shelf " components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW , and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit . PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA - 2 vehicles , with a first launch planned for 1995 , and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996 . My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design , with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro , a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro ( headquartered in the same building ) . The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering , launch operations , vehicle subsystems , and marketing support . Sumitomo Corp . of Tokyo , is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors . PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $ 550 K ( Some sources place this of high as $ 1 M ) , but has been searching for about a year for the additional $ 20-30 M needed to design , build and launch their first set of vehicles . The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board , but by my estimate , they will need much more than the single $ 6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware . ] 11 - CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED In early March , it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works . As reported in the Taipei press , China Development Corp . ( CDC ) , headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party , is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp . with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite . CDC would cover about 10 % of the satellite system cost ( US $ 10 M ) in exchange for rights to 10 % of the satellite's communications channels . [ Commentary : This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development ( released in mid January ) . In those plans , the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites , starting with ROCSAT - 1 , a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft , planned for launch in 1997 . Two additional satellites are planned , both communications satellites . TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program , budgeted at T $ 13.6 B ( US $ 530 M ) through 2006 . I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT , but there might be a connection . While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures , the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures . The reported name for the Tiawanese / Chinese system is " Asiasat - 2 " , but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based " Asiasat " program involving Chinese , Hong Kong , and other Asian investors , other than using it as an organizational model . There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture - - it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost , which then can be used in later satellite ventures . But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures , but putting any joint venture through a Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed . In any case , the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues . This is just another indicator to add to the list . ] 12 - SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES South Korea's Trade , Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US $ 22 B in research and development and another US $ 17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies . Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program , beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997 . The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000 . [ Commentary : South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry , specifically including space activities . I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market . As part of their national effort , 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta . Designated Koreasat 1 and 2 , the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula , southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea . South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992 , called Uribyol - 1 ( Our Star ) and costing about US $ 8.8 M . Uribyol - 2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year , again on Ariane , and will be entirely " made in Korea . " Uribyol - 3 , projected for a 1995 launch , will be an environment - monitoring micro-satellite . This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites , The KEOS ( Korean Earth Observation System ) project , which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government , would use two or three 300 - kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors . South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001 . Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort , funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001 , in anticipation of an expected pullout of U . S . intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula . In conjunction with all of these reported efforts , South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts ( for example , McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts ) , or for production of consumer space items ( among other products , South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan , and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals . ) . This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies . Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services ( primarily for telecommunications ) , a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade . ] 13 - SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH As announced in the last CSN / STI , each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments . The table below summarizes results to the end of March . The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole , as represented by the S & P 500 index . Since 90 + % of the values included in the index are US firms , this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms . The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 - - which is a very promising sign , although future months may reverse this trend . The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite well , but the Pure Play portfolio - - consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies - - has also surpassed its results in all of 1993 . We'll keep an eye on these ...

This column's already full ? And I still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on . As I said at the start of this , column there's been a lot of interesting happenings - but I'll have to put them into the next issue . Looking ahead , I've got several articles in the works on new happenings with Iridium and the LEO communications satellite market , more news on international launchers appearing ( and disappearing ) on the market , new international commercial space ventures , and other interesting developments .

But to add to this explaniation , each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe , just so the detector does not read the background radiation ( i . e . cosmic rays ) , if I remember right , the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the background . This is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays that would normally set it off .

When they use the _same_ deconvolution software on the images from the fixed Hubble , be ready for some incredible results ! There is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin . Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software . It works realtime , not after the fact , as is the case with Hubble . You might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market , in the form of the AO - 2 Adaptive Optics System . Starting on page 52 of the April , 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product . It lists for $ 1,290 . The article states : " The AO - 2 Adaptive Optics System comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry around . " Even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects , " it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter in the telescope's focal plane . " Now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years , especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars , and many man-hours invested in its development .

The Command Loss Timer is simply looking for a command , any command . A " no-op " is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big bit bucket in the sky . " No-op " also get used as timekeepers to provide millisecond delays between command sequences ( used on the thruster preps on GRO , er , Compton ) and to verify command links at the beginning of TDRS events .

Indeed , the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully enough ; in particular , its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a bit higher than you would see from a black body . Morgan & Gordon's fat " Communications Satellite Handbook " has a graph of sky temperature vs . wavelength , in fact , for communications design . However , in terms of energy content , the RF frequencies are negligible . For thermal purposes , at very large distances from the Sun the sky looks like a black body at 3.5 K ( Allen , " Astrophysical Quantities " ) . I haven't found a number for non-large distances , since solar radiation tends to be something you can't just ignore :-) , but M & G says " about 4K " in a brief discussion of why solar radiation dominates the problem . - - SVR 4 resembles a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR 3 and SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henryFrom : Mark.Prado@p2.f349.n109.z1.permanet.org ( Mark Prado ) Subject : Sixty-two thousand ( was Re : How many read sci.space ? ) Reply address : mark.prado@permanet.org If anyone knows anyone else who would like to get sci.space , but doesn't have an Internet feed ( or has a cryptic Internet feed ) , I would be willing to feed it to them .

( If you meant to say " propel " rather than " power " , the answer is " sort of " . ) Yes , you can use interaction with the Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power , and there are potential applications for this . However , bear in mind that there is no free lunch . The energy isn't coming from nowhere . What such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy . There are cases where this is a useful tradeoff . Using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations , however . What you * can * do is get your power by some other means , e . g . solar arrays , and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse , pumping energy * into * the orbit rather than taking energy out of it . If you want more information , trying looking up " electrodynamic propulsion " , " tether applications " , and " magsails " . > Can the idea of a " dragless " satellite be used in part to create the > electrical field ? No . A " dragless " satellite does not magically have no drag ; it burns fuel constantly to fight drag , maintaining the exact orbit it would have * if * there was no drag . This is why there are quotes around " dragless " . - - SVR 4 resembles a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR 3 and SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henryFrom : MUNIZB % RWTMS2.decnet@rockwell.com ( " RWTMS 2 :: MUNIZB " ) Subject : Space Activities in Tucson , AZ ?

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4 / Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch . It is also closer to 4 m in diameter . You've hit on the real kicker , however . The Centaur is pressure stabilized . It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks . Additionally , the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~ + / - 5 psi . That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train . The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance . On numerous occasions ( when I was there 88-91 ) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur . The answer - - a centaur not worth launching . The Atlas / Centaur does not require on-pad integration , however the T4 / Centaur does . I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration , so maybe something can be done there ... | > | > They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads | > ( unless the new Proton second stage is actually built ) , and of course | > any Centaur support systems and facilities , no doubt imported from the | > US at great cost .

The addition of LOX / LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off . A LHe facility is also needed . I don't know what the proton uses for fuel , but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do . If there is no cryo at the sight at all , the addition of these systems could be big $ $ , not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia . That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea . - - H . D .

Keep boxing the compass chaps , you ` ll get round to it eventually . The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship , with hybrid sail and steam propulsion . The Great Eastern , which broke the ' Little Giant ' financially and otherwise , was a revolutionary leap forward in ship design . A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel , with primary steam propulsion , it was at the time easily the biggest ocean going vessel ever built . Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale , while drag rose with the square , so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles without coaling . Unfortunately , there was no real market for such a beast at the time , and it was eventually sold off at scrap values . As another poster said , it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable laying ship . It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying a transatlantic cable in one go , with the endurance and capacity to carry the huge reel all the way , and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for defective sections . See Arthur C Clarke ` s book " How the World was One " [ I think that ` s right ] If that ` s how the Shuttle goes down in history , as a technical triumph and a financial disaster for the builder , it would not be entirely ignoble , but I doubt if history will be so charitable .

Mitchell March 23 , 1993 INTRODUCTION : In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations , a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models . These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers , for EduTainment purposes . Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space , including , but not limited to , layout of a lunar colony , tele-operating machines for work and play , disseminating educational information , providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods . Because of the nature of the LTM 1 project , people of all ages , interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals , models and structures , interfacing and electronics , software and graphics . In operation LTM 1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children , students and professionals worldwide . Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM 1 base for experimental or recreational purposes . Because a real facility exists , ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model , its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves . This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups : - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control , model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets , cars and trains - children - the child in all of us LTM 1 OVERALL DESIGN : A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout . The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains , star fields and a view of the earth . The " floor " is the simulated lunar surface . A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface , and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements , scenery , and machine-lets . The LTM 1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets : 1 . An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off , hover and land ; 2 . A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area ; and 3 . A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface . Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it . A personal computer digitizes the image ( including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes ) and also return control signals . The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal . The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM 1 . Next , an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off , hover over the entire lunar landscape and land . Finally , some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets . The entire initial LTM 1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff , traveling and doing work . The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware / software developers . By taking a graphically oriented communications program ( Dmodem ) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls , the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours . PLAN OF ACTION : The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network . Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model . Diaspar has , in stock , the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip . Diaspar also agrees to provide " rail stock " for the lunar train model . Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets . An initial " ground breaking " with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30 , 1993 . The initial models will be put in place . A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes . It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn . The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building , operations and experiments . A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to . gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's . A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas , time , talent , materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony . A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced . Universities will be invited to participate , the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model . Field trips to LTM 1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model . Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus . A monthly LTM 1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media . Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media . Having a large , real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community . Especially since the " action " will be controlled by people all over the world . Science fiction writers will be invited to issue " challenges " to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks . Using counter-weight and pulley systems , 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges . The long term goal is creating world-wide interest , education , experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony . LTM 1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment . All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars ! CONCLUSION : EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment . Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation , education and experimentation purposes . By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity , but also a method of trying new ideas that require real ( not virtual ) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space .

D1 ) . I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate . Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the " Space Age " in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over , and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time . Reading , for example , " What's New " - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter : by which I include biotechnology , condensed matter physics ( with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere ) , and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days . To a large extent , I think , the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia . I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely , our " mind children " - will spread across space ( unless we wipe ourselves out ); but I think that * manned * space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do * now * . Anyway , let me quote some of this article , but not all ... SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW Micheal Schrage ( writer , consultant , and research associate at MIT ) At 35 , America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis . The reason is that the Space Age is already dead . The technologies no longer define our times , and the public has grown weary of the multibillion - dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards . Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue . Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate , our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy . To be sure , America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead .

... Before the change in administrations , it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age . The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $ 30 billion to build space station Freedom alone . Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains , Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures . The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much . Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets . Indeed , with few notable exceptions , such as Voyager , the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more .  

... While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess . The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed . Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda .

What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work . It is called leadership Allen . That is what made Apollo work . Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people . That is leadership and responsibility . There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is . You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job . Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem ? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place . There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen , but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership . I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you ? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem . Lack of leadership from the White House , Congress and at Reston . Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem .

From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet , the instrument payload constraints are : Mass allocation - 7 kilograms ( 15.4 lbs ) Power allocation - 6 watts Required instruments : Visible imaging system ( 1024x1024 CCD , 750 mm fl , f / 10 optics ) IR mapping spectrometer ( 256x256 HgCdTe array , 0.3 % energy resolution ) UV spectrometer ( 55-200 nm , 0.5 nm resolution ) Radio science ( ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system ) ultrastable means 10 ^ - 14 . This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated to the mission of the spacecraft . In addition , the power will come from a radioisotope thermal generator , and the whole space craft will be about 2 feet in diameter , with no booms , which means there will be strong gamma-lines from Pu - 239 and associated schmutz in the background , which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat .

I'd be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be accounted for by the AF's requirement for superfluous 2167 documentation , 5 or 6 huge requirements and design reviews , travel expenses flying personnel around to meetings , and over specifying the hardware . I doubt that the actual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from SDIO's costs .

The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship . Now , in an atmosphere I can see this . The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere , which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate . But in a vacuum , only two things I can see are going to hit the plate : fission / fusion products ( barium , krypton , helium , neutrons , evaporated bomb casing ) and electromagnetic radiation ( gammas mostly , some light / heat from irradiated fission products ) . Would this work ? I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum ( especially given the mass of the pusher plate ) , and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there . I must be missing something . Would someone enlighten me via email ?

Unfortunately , I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message clear , since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance , rather than space surveillance What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at the Earth ( satellite reconnaissance ) , but _was_ which countries have programs to detect and track ( i . e . , determine the orbital elements of ) satellites as they pass overhead ( space surveillance ) . The US uses missile-defense radars , supplemented by a fascinating quasi-radar operated by the Navy , to do this for satellites in LEO , and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so . The FEE , I understand , does much the same thing . Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs , binoculars , stopwatches and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km , enabling them to keep track of satellites for which , ah , official element sets aren't available . See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details , as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov . The material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree , and it may be that other countries do also . Which was the question I meant to ask : who are they , how do they do it , and why do they do it ?

The " artist renderings " that I've seen of the HST reboost still have the arrays fully extended , with a cradle holding HST at a ~ 30 degree angle to the Shuttle .

The choice would seem to be one or the other , since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing . 4 ) If your answer to 3 ) above was " the astronomers " , then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the ( to my mind ) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT .

On April 9 , real-time commands were sent , as planned , to reacquire celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna ( LGA - 2 ) swing / Dual Drive Actuator ( DDA ) hammer activities . 2 . On April 9 , the EJ - 1 ( Earth-Jupiter # 1 ) sequence memory load was uplinked to the spacecraft without incident . This sequence covers spacecraft activity from April 12 , 1993 to June 14 , 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay Antenna ( RRA ) slew test on April 28 , 1993 . The command loss timer was set to 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load . 3 . On April 12 and 15 , a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours , its planned value during this mission phase . 4 . On April 12 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) , Dust Detector ( DDS ) , and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instruments . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 5 . On April 12 , an Ultra-Stable Oscillator ( USO ) test was performed to verify the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment data ; long term trend analysis is continuing . 6 . On April 14 , a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( SNR ) when transmitting at 40bps . Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level . 7 . On April 15 , cruise science Memory Readouts ( MROs ) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer ( EUV ) and Magnetometer ( MAG ) instrument . Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly . 8 . On April 15 , a periodic RPM ( Retro-Propulsion Module ) 10 - Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed ; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity . Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal . 9 . The AC / DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes ( greater than 25 DN ) throughout this period . The AC measurement reads 19 DN ( 4.3 volts ) . The DC measurement reads 111 DN ( 12.9 volts ) . These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC / DC special anomaly team . 10 . The Spacecraft status as of April 15 , 1993 , is as follows : a ) System Power Margin - 60 watts b ) Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c ) Spin Rate / Sensor - 3.15 rpm / Star Scanner d ) Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees off-sun ( lagging ) and 6 degrees off-earth ( leading ) e ) Downlink telemetry rate / antenna - 40bps ( coded ) / LGA - 1 f ) General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g ) RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h ) Orbiter Science - Instruments powered on are the PWS , EUV , UVS , EPD , MAG , HIC , and DDS i ) Probe / RRH - powered off , temperatures within acceptable range j ) CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 260 hours GDS ( Ground Data Systems ): 1 . Galileo participated in a second DSN ( Deep Space Network ) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13 , 1993 , using CTA - 21 ( Compatibility Test Area 21 ) . The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller ( TGC ) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly ( TCA ) . The TGC / TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly ( TPA ) . Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test ; all ran well on both the MTS ( MCCC Telemetry Subsystem ) and the AMMOS MGDS V18 . 0 GIF with the exception of 10bps . The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock ; it appears the TGC / TCA was not metering the data correctly . Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted . MVT ( Mission Verification Test ) of the TGC / TCA system is expected to begin May 16 , 1993 . TRAJECTORY As of noon Thursday , April 15 , 1993 , the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows : Distance from Earth 152,606 , 000 km ( 1.02 AU ) Distance from Sun 277,519 , 800 km ( 1.86 AU ) Heliocentric Speed 93,400 km per hour Distance from Jupiter 543,973 , 900 km Round Trip Light Time 17 minutes , 4 seconds SPECIAL TOPIC 1 . As of April 15 , 1993 , a total of 70184 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch . Of these , 65076 were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process . In the past week , 7 real time commands were transmitted : 6 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process .

Thanks , RobFrom : Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org Subject : Space Advertising ( 2 of 2 ) Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993 . First , in February , the Russians deployed a 20 - m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station . While this " Banner " reflector was blank , NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers , who could use a space - based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial , as filmed from the Mir . The second development , has been that Space Marketing Inc , the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft , is now pushing the " Environmental Billboard " . As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , the " Environmental Billboard " is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters . Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area , deployed by the inflatable ' frame ' . To help sell the concept , the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry " ozone reading sensors " to " continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer , " according to Mike Lawson , head of SMI . Furthermore , the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere . According to IMI , " as the biodegradable material burns , it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer . " The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it , too , re-enters and burns up and " adds to the ozone supply . " This would not be a cheap advertisement , costing at least several millions of dollars ( exact costs were not available ) . But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5 X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl , where a 30 - second advertising ' unit ' cost $ 600,000 . Since SMI is located in Atlanta , Georgia , it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . But back to Brian's questions : > And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN > news blip ? How serious is this project ? Is this just in the " wild > idea " stage or does it have real funding ? See above . As for serious - - if they can get $ 15-20 M or so ( my estimate of $ 5-10 for development costs and a flight unit , plus $ 10-15 M for a launch ) , then it's probably real . They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch . That's a $ 10-15 M cost they need to raise , right there . And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well . Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already . While I don't think the legal challenges would win out ( and yes , I am an amateur astronomer , and no , I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution , but I know of no prohibition of it ... ) , the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising . I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this - - which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure , and negate the space advertising advantage . ( Would you spend $ 15 M to look like an idiot ? ) ( And light pollution might not be too bad - - if it's in a low enough orbit , and it relies upon reflected light only , it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn . For maximum market exposure , you want to have it visible just after dusk - - minimizing impact on astronomy , since that's the time of worse seeing due to day / night thermal turbulence . It might still be a problem , but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this ... ) As for having real funding - - none that I can identify . There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity , but that included curious folks and was for only a $ 500,000 commitment . I haven't heard of any serious funding for this , but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more . But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time . And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro , please be my guest . I don't have posting privileges to that area ( or at least I don't THINK I do ... ) . - - - Wales Larrison Space Technology Investor - - - Maximus 2.01 wbFrom : tholen@newton.ifa.hawaii.edu ( Dave Tholen ) Subject : Re : Command Loss Timer ( Re : Galileo Update - 04/22 / 93 ) Alan Carter writes : > > 3 .

Could > someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is ? The name is rather descriptive . It's a command to the spacecraft that tells it " If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours , assume something is wrong with your ( the spacecraft ) attitude , and go into a preprogrammed search mode in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth . " The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other . Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft , and if everything is fine , there's no reason to send it any new information . But from the spacecraft's point of view , no information from Earth could mean either everything is fine , or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition . Just how long should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and begins to take corrective action ? That " how long " is the command loss timer . During relatively inactive cruise phases , the command loss timer can be set to rather long values . In this case , Earth is telling Galileo " expect to hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours " .From : Leigh Palmer <palmer@sfu.ca> Subject : Re : Orion drive in vacuum - - how ?

Doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals . The reason people are so fond of it is that it's the * only * chance we have now , or will have for a * long * time to come , to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs . There is no Shuttle successor in funded development , NASP is dwindling away , and ALS / NLS / Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any zeroes off that $ 2000 - $ 3000 per pound cost . Part of the blame for this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the , er , Free World's available space cash . As you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come . (-: DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental " X-plane " hardware . It's been , to my mind , incredibly successful already - - they've built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks . I would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s America , never mind flying the thing , getting a successor funded , or building the DC-Y . I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any expansion of astronautics . I don't see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs , for multi-ton payloads , anywhere else . If the DC flops , it'll be business as usual in space . The Nineties and the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties , a prospect too depressing to bear . ( Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction . It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks . It's creating its own market for small payloads . ) I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs . There are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems , some of them as good as or better than SSTO . There is no sign in today's world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line . > You could change my view on DC-X if you could prove the following : [ ... deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight ... ] > 3 that the shuttle need not go on hiatus to allow development of a man-ratable > DC-X successor Strawman . Is anybody seriously proposing this ? References , please . The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate , which includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle operations , as well as the " bird in the hand " argument your common sense tells you . If DC-Y flies at all , it flies alongside the Shuttle , not instead of it .

I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion . We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now . We precede any orbiting mission with flyby missions . Of course , it gets harder to do as we work our way farther away from Earth . We're just starting to work out to the outer planets : Galileo will orbit Jupiter , and Cassini around Saturn . > How about a mission ( unmanned ) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things > around and near and on Pluto .. Well first things first . We'll do a flyby mission first since it is much easier and faster to do . If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then we'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade . A Pluto orbiter however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period . Orbit insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto . I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting mission before a Pluto orbiting mission , unless the Pluto flyby turns up something really interesting . ___ ___ ___ / _ / | / ___ / \ / _ / | Ron Baalke | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | | __ \ / | | | | Jet Propulsion Lab | ___ | | | | | __ ) | / | | | __ M / S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand / ___ | | | | ___ / | | / __ / | Pasadena , CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and | ___ | / | _ | / | ___ | / | part vegetable .From : prb@access.digex.com ( Pat ) Subject : Re : Why DC - 1 will be the way of the future .

Although he got most of his answers wrong , he did definitively identify what the important questions are . I think it was Descartes who said that " All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato . " If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime , that's simple ... it is Aristotle . This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as " the philosopher " . Regarding Nietzsche , he's one of the most entertaining , although since his ideas were so fragmented ( and since his life was cut short ) it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now . They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though . As for " modern " philosophers , I would have to say that Kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him ( and unfortunately , they maintained his errors and amplified them over time ) . I would say that the most influential " american " philosopher would have to be Dewey . But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years , it may very well be Ayn Rand ( who in every important respect was " American " , but was born in Russia ) . But I guess that remains to be seen . - - BrianFrom : stgprao@st.unocal.COM ( Richard Ottolini ) Subject : Re : moon image in weather sat image In article <C6B2pA.My4@usenet.ucs.indiana.edu> turner@bigbang.astro.indiana.edu ( George Wm Turner ) writes : > > > an image of the moon has been caught in a weather satellite images of the earth . > it appears in both the 0430-1500 UT ir and visual images of the earth . > the GIF images can be down loaded from vmd.cso.uiuc.edu and are named > CI043015.GIF and CV043015.GIF for the IR and visual images respectively . > > pretty cool pictures ; in the ir it's saturated but in the visual image > details on the moon are viewable .

If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration , sure you can use chemical rockets for that part ... but even just doing the deceleration chemically is a major headache . We're talking seriously high cruising velocities ; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels .

For the most up to date information on upcoming missions , call ( 407 ) 867 - INFO (8 67-4636 ) at Kennedy Space Center . Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news frequently . WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF ? The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks ( kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov ) . The " Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual , " ASC G & C 2102 , says : " During the vertical rise phase , the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I-loaded V ( rel ) sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved . Then , the tilt maneuver ( roll program ) orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q-alpha , which in turn alleviates structural loading . Other advantages with this attitude are performance gain , decreased abort maneuver complexity , improved S-band look angles , and crew view of the horizon . The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff ( MECO ) target in second stage . " This really is a good answer , but it's couched in NASA jargon . I'll try to interpret . 1 ) We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling . 2 ) Then , we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere ( the " relative wind " ) and the chord of the wings ( the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge ) is a slightly negative angle ( " a negative q-alpha " ) . This causes a little bit of " downward " force ( toward the belly of the Orbiter , or the + Z direction ) and this force " alleviates structural loading . " We have to be careful about those wings - - they're about the most " delicate " part of the vehicle . 3 ) The new attitude ( after the roll ) also allows us to carry more mass to orbit , or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass , or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll ( " performance gain " ) . 4 ) The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers , the Return To Launch Site ( " decreased abort maneuver complexity " ) . 5 ) The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio antennae on the Orbiter ( " improved S-band look angles " ) . 6 ) The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon , which is a helpful ( but not mandatory ) part of piloting any flying machine . 7 ) The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground , and the nose to the east ( usually ) . This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit . Remember : velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction . The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit . This all begs the question , " Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with ? Why does the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude ? " The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo days . The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches - - one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust , one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust . ( You can see the effects of this on any daytime launch . The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage , and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white steam . Watch for the difference between the " top " [ Orbiter side ] and the " bottom " [ External Tank side ] of the stack . ) The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's . ( A side note : the Saturn V's also had a roll program . Don't ask me why - - I'm a Shuttle guy . ) I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics . He added that the " roll maneuver " is really a maneuver in all three axes : roll , pitch and yaw . The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated . The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack ( q-alpha ) within a tight tolerance . The yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination . The total maneuver is really expressed as a " quaternion , " a grad-level-math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element array . HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL , NASA SELECT NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite . If you have access to a satellite dish , you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R , Transponder 13 , C-Band , 72 degrees West Longitude , Audio 6.8 , Frequency 3960 MHz . F2R is stationed over the Atlantic , and is increasingly difficult to receive from California and points west . During events of special interest ( e . g . shuttle missions ) , SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite for these viewers . If you can't get a satellite feed , some cable operators carry SELECT . It's worth asking if yours doesn't . The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is frequently posted to sci.space.news . Generally it carries press conferences , briefings by NASA officials , and live coverage of shuttle missions and planetary encounters . SELECT has recently begun carrying much more secondary material ( associated with SPACELINK ) when missions are not being covered .

Yes , but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements . You're saying basically that it met the engineering specs ( which is questionable , IMHO ) so it's a success , never mind that you couldn't get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in a thousand years . > The shuttle is the only reusable space vehicle .

You can get hypersonic flight data with an X - 15 or a follow-on X - 15 type vehicle for much less . And economics and engineering are interchangable ; engineering in the absense of economics is basically just physics , and in terms of physics , the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X - 15 .

" I hate to pour cold water on this , but currently seawater extracted uranium , even using the new , improved fiber absorbers from Japan , is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market .

Palmer palmer@alumni.caltech.edu palmer@tgrs.gsfc.nasa.govFrom : eder@hsvaic.boeing.com ( Dani Eder ) Subject : Re : Guns for Space Okay , lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun . The project manager is Dr . John Hunter , and he works for the Laser group at Livermore . What , you may ask , does gas guns have to do with lasers ? Nothing , really , but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building , and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room ( thick walls ) from which the gun firings are controlled . So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience . I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb . and we toured the gun . At the time I was working on gas gun R & D at Boeing , where I work , but I am now doing other things ( helping to save the space station ) , The gun uses a methane-air mixture , which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID ( i . e . it looks like a pipe ) . The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m / s down the chamber . On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas , initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres . The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures , at around 50,000 psi . The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore . It is mounted at right angles to the chamber ( i . e . they intersect ) . This was done so that in the future , the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber . The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic , 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long . All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel . The barrel is evacuated , and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film ( a little thicker than Saran wrap ) . The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile . The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs . In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found . At the higher speeds in later testing , the projectile vaporizes . The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across , and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range . The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete , where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean , and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles . The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km / s ( half of orbital speed ) . So far they have reached 2 km / s , and the gun is currently down for repairs , as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware ( I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning , but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this ) . There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air ( at Mach 12 = 4 km / s ) , since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8 . This gun cost about 4 million to develop , and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful - sized payloads into space . This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles , which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit .

Pat , this would be slower , more expensive and worse . Slower : The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December . That's less than eight months away . There is no way you could build new hardware , retrain and reschedule the EVA's in that time . More Expensive : Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it was going to do execpt fire the OMS . In addition , you've added significant extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware . According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me , there are only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle - - HST and AXAF . Since AXAF has since been scaled back and HST can rely on the shuttle , there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Find a way or make one .

I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter with the orbiter bay doors shut ; but still there would be lots of contamination worries .

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS Despite a widespread belief to the contrary , the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost . They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm . The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings , it is finding vendors who can supply mid - 1960 ' s vintage hardware ( like guidance system components ) , and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use , so you have no place to launch from . By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pads , you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design . WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being " scooped " by people uninvolved in the mission . However , NASA frequently releases examples ( in non-digital form , e . g . photos ) to the public early in a mission . RISKS OF NUCLEAR ( RTG ) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous . Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios ( shuttle explosion during launch , or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities ) , the risks are extremely small . Two interesting data points are ( 1 ) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 RTGs , which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach orbit . The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium . ( 2 ) In April 1970 , the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source , which was jettisoned , fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean . The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half-lives of the Pu - 238 fuel or about 870 years [ DOE 1980 ] .

C . , April 1980 . ) IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER From time to time , claims are made that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters ( SRBs ) are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer . Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact , both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources . The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study , Charles Jackman . The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups , and was organized by Dr . Michael Prather , NASA / Goddard Institute for Space Studies . The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia ( NASA / GISS ) , Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass ( NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center ) , and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze ( Atmospheric and Environmental Research , Inc . ) . The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere . The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine : Industrial sources : 300,000 , 000 kilograms / year Natural sources : 75,000 , 000 kilograms / year Shuttle sources : 725,000 kilograms / year The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly . Thus the launches would add less than 0.25 % to the total stratospheric chlorine sources . The effect on ozone is minimal : global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0.0065 % . This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares . The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 % decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 . The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible . The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time . Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere _ , MJ Prather , MM Garcia , AR Douglass , CH Jackman , M . K . W . Ko and N . D .

Holding your breath is likely to damage your lungs , something scuba divers have to watch out for when ascending , and you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up , but theory predicts - - and animal experiments confirm - - that otherwise , exposure to vacuum causes no immediate injury . You do not explode . Your blood does not boil . You do not freeze . You do not instantly lose consciousness . Various minor problems ( sunburn , possibly " the bends " , certainly some [ mild , reversible , painless ] swelling of skin and underlying tissue ) start after ten seconds or so . At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen . Injuries accumulate . After perhaps one or two minutes , you're dying . The limits are not really known .

HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion . This is a well-documented fact ; see the Rogers Commission report , for example . What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart . The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts , never mind destroy their bodies , according to the Kerwin team's medical / forensic report . The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200MPH , and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater . Their remains were recovered , and after the Kerwin team examined them , they were sent off to be buried . USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can't get there . It is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel , even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks . Furthermore , it is not particularly sensible to do so , because much of that weight is things like wings , which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth . The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit . Taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful . A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit spacecraft . [ Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer . ] THE " FACE ON MARS " There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face . It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery : 35A72 ( much more facelike in appearance , and the one more often published , with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon ) and 70A13 ( with the Sun 27 degrees from the west ) . Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is artificial , intended to resemble a human , and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization . Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental . Other Viking images show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on Mars . There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society ( sorry , don't know the address ) to study the Face . The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera , and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years .

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate project . But why ?

Larson , 1984 , North Pacific Publishers , Portland , Oregon , 456 pages , indexed , hardcover . " THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION " contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries . This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged edition of " THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE " , 1959 . Volume I is " NOTHING BUT MOTION " ( 1979 ) , and Volume II is " THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER " ( 1988 ) . Most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals , partial differentials , and other FANCY MATHEMATICS . In this book , by contrast , mathematics is conspicuous by its absence , except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text . Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual validity . Dewey B . Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University . He developed the Theory described in his books while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements they contain . " THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION " describes the astrophysical portions of Larson's CONSISTENT , INTEGRATED , COMPREHENSIVE , GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , a kind of " grand unified field theory " that orthodox physicists and astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for . It is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time : ( 1 ) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component , MOTION , existing in THREE dimensions , in DISCRETE units , and with two RECIPROCAL aspects , SPACE and TIME . ( 2 ) The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics , its primary magnitudes are ABSOLUTE , and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN . From these two postulates , Larson was able to build a COMPLETE theoretical universe , from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies , by combining the concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with translational , vibrational , rotational , and rotational - vibrational motions . At each step in the development , he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe , including EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED . For example , in his 1959 book , he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES , several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them . They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory . And when quasars were discovered , he had a related explanation ready for those also . As a result of his theory , which he called " THE RECIPROCAL SYSTEM " , Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists , including black holes , neutron stars , degenerate matter , quantum wave mechanics ( as applied to atomic structure ) , " nuclear " physics , general relativity , relativistic mass increases , relativistic Doppler shifts , nuclear fusion in stars , and the big bang , all of which he considered to be nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES . He was very critical of the AD HOC assumptions , uncertainty principles , solutions in principle , " no other way " declarations , etc . , used to maintain them . " THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION " is divided into 31 chapters . It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters , which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe . ( Galaxy formation from the MYTHICAL " big bang " is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers . ) He then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of SINGLE stars . Several chapters are devoted to quasars which , according to Larson , are densely-packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT ( although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME ) . Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an OPEN MIND . For example , they used to believe that GAMMA RAY BURSTS originated from pulsars , which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy . But the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any visible objects , ( except for a few cases of directional coincidence ) . Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe , which Larson calls the " cosmic sector " . Because the anti-matter universe exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe , with the speed of light as the BOUNDARY between them , and has THREE dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space , the bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly at random . Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books , journal articles , and leading physicists and astronomers . In this book , 351 of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book . For example , a quote from the book " Astronomy : The Cosmic Journey " , by William K . Hartmann , says , " Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars form ... Unfortunately we cannot . " Larson's book contains LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists , astronomers , and astrophysicists .

Maybe you have | something here , but could you please clarify it for us on the net ? | RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days . before it was listed as 9 days . they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5 , after simulations indicated that it was not do-able in 4 . After all the space walking , they are going to re-boost the HST's orbit . I think right now it's sitting at 180 miles up , they would like 220 . I don't know the exact orbit numbers . I know when HST was first flown , it was placed in the Highest possible Shuttle orbit . Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet , or extended duration orbiter pallet . It's mostly LOX / LH for the fuel cells and RCS gear , plus more O2 and canisters for the life support re-breathers . maybe more nitrogen too . THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies ( MASS ) and Orbiter Duration . In order to perform the re-boost of the HST , the OMS engines will be fired for a long period . Now the shuttle is a heavy thing . THe HST isn't light either . THe amount of OMS fuel needed to fly both up is substantial . a small booster carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly less then the OMS fuel required to Boost both HST and SHUttle , for a given orbital change . From what i understand , the mass margins on the HST missions are tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's . Now if they used a small tug , I would bet , just a wild guess , that the savings on amss margin would allow carrying the EDO pallet , extra suits , more consumables , parts for the flaky FGS sensor , parts for the balky solar electronics , and still enough for a double magnum of champagne . or the HST could even get placed into some sort of medium orbit . The reason they want a high orbit , is less antenna pointing , and longer drag life . | > and that means you can then carry EDO packs and enough consumables | > so the SHuttle mission can go on long enough to also fix the | > array tilt motors , and god knows what else is going to wear out | | From what I've heard , the motors are fine - it is one of the two | sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix .

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space , but not really , I want to answer this for their , as well as everyone else's information . What these people are proposing , by and large already exists and can be purchased today . It is called labview by National Instruments . IT is a wonderful object oriented graphical programming language . IT has been implemented on both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes . IT is fare superior to any programming approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent . This program is not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis capability . Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist ? It is a great idea but look out there at what is available today . The Hydrogen leak on the Shuttle was found using this software . All SSME control and simulation studies , along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW . There are tons of applications , with the ability to create " virtual " instruments that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires . With the addition of IEEE - 488 support , the computer becomes a virtual control station , allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation . With serial I / O support that instrument can be anywhere . The ground control software for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach .

Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible . The CGRO , is , what , 10 meters long ? You'd need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this . What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors ( also as a function of photon energy ) . Each of the detectors does not have isotropic response . To do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector , and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto the spacecraft .

Sorry , you have a _wish_ for an uncluttered night sky , but it isn't a right . When you get down to it , you actually have no rights that the majority haven't agreed to give you ( and them in the process ) . It's a common misconception that being born somehow endows you with rights to this that and the other . Sadly this is not true .

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit ( SSTO ) rocket ship . The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week . Flight tests will start in mid-June . Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky , the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy . The SDI Organization - - which paid $ 60 million for the DC-X - - can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle . To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA , SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies . SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns . However , recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority . Today , the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost , reusable sounding rocket . SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies , said Col . Simon " Pete " Worden , SDIO's deputy for technology . But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program . " I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend , " he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters . While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective , agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the " better , faster , cheaper " approach to hardware development . The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that " leapfrog " ahead of evolutionary technology developments . Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a " build a little , test a little " approach can produce results on time and within budget . He said the program - - which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months - - showed how today's engineers could move beyond the " miracles of our parents ' time . " " The key is management , " Worden said . " SDIO had a very light hand on this project . We had only one overworked major , Jess Sponable . " Although the next phase may involve more agencies , Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial . " It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially . " SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science , Space and Technology Committee . " This is the direction we're going to have to go , " said Rep . George Brown , the committee's Democratic chairman . " Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable ... NASA hasn't learned it yet . SDIO has . " Rep . Dana Rohrbacher , Brown's Republican colleague , went further . Joking that " a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team , " Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency . Rohrbacher , whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas , also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional , multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology . " Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top . Let's build a spaceship ! " Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship , he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology . McDonnell Douglas , which faces very uncertain prospects with its C - 17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs , were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment . " On very large ventures , companies put in seed money , " said Charles Ordahl , McDonnell Douglas ' senior vice president for space systems . " You need strong government investments . " While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA , they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development . Citing corporate history , they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft . Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC - 3 transport , a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper ( DC - 1 ) . Flight tests this summer at White Sands will " expand the envelope " of performance , with successive tests increasing speed and altitude . The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering , verticle take-off and landing . The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet . The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet . Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase . The final tests will include a " pitch-over " manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft , four-legged landing . The flight test series will be supervised by Charles " Pete " Conrad , who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing . Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president , Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations . Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance . If the program moves to the next stage , engine technology will become a key consideration . This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A - 5 engines used on the DC-X . Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages , the A - 5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability . It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround . Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union . The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes . The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place . Pratt has a technology agreement with NPO Energomash , the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines .From : ken@sugra.uucp ( Kenneth Ng ) Subject : Re : HST Servicing Mission Scheduled for 11 Days In article < C6B0By.1C9@zoo.toronto.edu : henry@zoo.toronto.edu ( Henry Spencer ) writes : : In article <1993Apr30.101054.1@stsci.edu> hathaway@stsci.edu writes : : > ...

I don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere unless they are greatly exaggerated .

The * total mass * of the Pluto Fast Flyby spacecraft is only 250ish pounds , and most of that is support equipment like power and communications . The mass available for instruments is maybe 10 % of that . I don't think a BATSE will fit ... Actually , would you need the shielding ? My understanding is that it's mostly there to give the detectors some directionality . No point in doing that if you've only got one . I'm sure the burst detectors that have flown on other deep-space missions haven't weighed that much .

These burst detectors are just that , burst detectors . They have no angular resolution . Now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution , but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort cloud or not .

IS THIS ONE THE " SPINOFFS " WE WERE PROMISED ? In 1950 , science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published " The Man Who Sold the Moon , " which involved a dispute over the sale of rights to the Moon for use as billboard . NASA has taken the firsteps toward this hideous vision of the future . Observers were startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the pad with " SCHWARZENEGGER " painted in huge block letters on the side of the booster rockets . Space Marketing Inc . had arranged for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie . Now , Space Marketing is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth orbit . NASA would provide contractual launch services . However , since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates ( WN 26 Mar 93 ) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense . This may look like environmental vandalism , but Mike Lawson , CEO of Space Marketing , told us yesterday that the real purpose of the project is to help the environment ! The platform will carry ozone monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs .
... What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize the night sky ? It is not even April 1 anymore . What about light pollution in observations ? ( I read somewhere else that it might even be visible during the day , leave alone at night ) . Is NASA really supporting this junk ? Are protesting groups being organized in the States ?

Comet Gehrels 3 , which was discovered in 1977 , was determined to have been in a temporary Jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973 .
