From : bolson@carson.u.washington.edu ( Edward Bolson ) Subject : Re : Sphere from 4 points ? I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code , which I will also include . The intersection of 3 planes method looks best , but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work . I may be misinterpreting , of course . I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products , but the former may actually be better . In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed ( implicitly in the solution of linear equations ) . To get the planes , I was taking the midpoint of the line from , say , P1 to P2 , and setting the normal as the " normalized " vector from P1 to P2 . These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems . HOwever , the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points ( for different tests ) . My matrix / vector math is very rusty , but it looks like I need to verify the formula , or use the simultaneous equation solution , which will require bringing in another routine I don't have ( but should be easy to find ) . Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points , and intersecting the normals from there . This would also define the circle center . However , small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect . Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel .

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself , but perhaps someone here will find them useful . They are certainly useable as they are , but are missing some higher-level functionality . They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming , a starting point . * * * The library assumes a 386 processor , but it is trivial to modify it * * * for a 286 . If enough people ask , I'll make the mods and re-post it as a * * * different version . The routines are written in assembly ( TASM ) and are callable from C . They are fairly simple , but I've found them to be very fast ( for my purposes , anyway ) . Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h , define a " virtual screen " , put and get pixels , put a pixmap ( rectangular image with no transparent spots ) , put a sprite ( image with see-thru areas ) , copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory , etc . I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line , as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer . I also wrote a quick'n'dirty ( tm ) demo program that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three " windows " . The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in / pub / dos / vgl.zip It is zipped with pkzip 2.04 g It is completely in the public domain , as far as I'm concerned .

Computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build , visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects . While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline , they are often unfamiliar with the terminology , simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists . Similarly , chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing . This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software . Although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design , data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own . Lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming ( IBM Visualization Data Explorer software ) and students will have access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources , including video recording equipment . Audience : researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art computer graphics into their research ; computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization . The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a first-come first-served basis . Level : Graduate / advanced undergraduate , 1 or 2 Credits . May be taken without credit as a workshop . Calculus , linear algebra and introductory chemistry required . Familiarity with Unix , X-windows and C is useful but not required .

Schmidt ) Subject : outlining of spline surface About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult . I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and ( hopefully ) some published solutions to it . The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines . For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional , i . e . only extant between the edges , but which exists in three dimensional space . To draw the object we 1 ) fit a cubic spline through the points . Each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve . Each spline has an equal number of segments . We assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly , but not exactly , the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure . 2 ) Take each segment ( n ) along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline . Use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface . 3 ) Depth sort the triangles 4 ) Take each triangle in sorted order , project onto a 2D pixmap , draw and color the triangle . Take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special " edge color " It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem . The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface . The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface . The reasons for this are fairly complicated . They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines . If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area . - ThanksFrom : rgc3679@bcstec.ca.boeing.com ( Robert G .

Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing | > information on the subject ? | > | > Regards | > | > Simon Basically , there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside , outside or on the polygon . The first one is Ray ( or half line ) method . In this method , you can draw any ray , if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even , then it is outside . If the number is odd , then it is inside . Of cause , you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache . The second method is PI algorithm . Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon . Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines . If the result is 2 * PI , then it is inside . If PI , then it is on the polygon . Otherwise it is outside . My experience tells the second method is relible . Hope this helps .

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3 - D interactive applications what types of 3 - D widgets you would like to have in your applications . A 3 - D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3 - D objects of the application . It may let you - manipulate application data , the camera , 3 - D objects in the scene and so on , or - view the status of the application or 3 - D objects via the widget's shape , color , position , orientation and so on , or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible . For example , a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball ( shown as a partially transparent sphere ) super-imposed on the object to be rotated . A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects . The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance . A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback . For example , the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis . Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3 - D interaction . The information I gathered will help me design a 3 - D UI construction tool . Your help is very much appreciated .

These standards should facilitate the creation of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice , Video , Telecommuting , HiRes graphics , Conferencing , Distant Learning , Online order entry , Fax , in addition these dicussion would assist all to better understand how SGML , CALS , ODA , MIME , OODBMS , JPEG , MPEG , FRACTALS , SQL , CDrom , cdromXA , Kodak PhotoCD , TCL , V.FAST , EIA / TIA 562 , can best be incorporated and implemented to develop TELEMATIC / Multimedia applications ... We want to be able to support DOS , UNIX , MAC , WINDOWS , NT , OS / 2 platforms . It is our hope that individuals , developers , corporations , Universities , R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor . This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter . Already many corporation have decided to support OTG ( Open TELEMATIC Group ) so do not delay joining if you are a developer An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon be be compose to start promulgating what is known on the subject . If you would like to be added to the mailist send email or mail to the address below . This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS / JPEG newsletter as well as a hardcopy version . We urge all who wants to see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS / JPEG G R O W , decide to join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor . NOTE : Telematic has been defined by Mr . James Martin as the marriage of Voice , Video , Hi-res Graphics , Fax , IVR , Music over telephone lines / LAN .

Speaking of SIGGRAPH , I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night , and was I ever grossed out ! The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery ! For example : SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $ 26 last year to $ 59 this year for the same thing , a 127 % increase . Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to $ 27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite , which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $ 32 ( or so ) for the proceedings and the art show catalog , essentially . TOPLAS went up 40 % in cost , way outstripping the current inflation rate . Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same , but whereas before SIGCHI membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings , these are now an extra cost option . Bundling that back into the basic rate , equivalent services have gone up 100 % in cost . SIGOIS membership cost has up 33 % , but they've also split out the Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership . Adding that cost back in means this SIG also has doubled its membership fee . What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services , and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services . But with the exception of a couple , like SIGGRAPH , all the " plus " services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big . But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90 % more than last year for a 31 % increase in services ( measured by cost , not by value ) , and , curiously , a 31 % inflation rate on the publications I got last year .

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator . 256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact . 640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is a BIOS mode . I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either . If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480 .

Well , GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987 ( ? ) or so . It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system . GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme ( LZW ? ) . IFF is not really a graphics format , but rather a standard way to package images , sounds , animations , text , or whatever into one file . IFF was created by Electronic Arts , I do believe ( I could be wrong ) , for the Amiga . It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga . The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM ( InterLeaved BitMap ? ) but many others exist . This format supports 24 bit color images . Information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in the directory / pub / graphics.formats ( Taken from the FAQ for this news group . ) :) Wayne Rigby rigby@cs.unr.eduFrom : sigma@rahul.net ( Kevin Martin ) Subject : Re : TIFF : philosophical significance of 42 In <1r0ms5$k65@ratatosk.uninett.no> joachim@kih.no ( joachim lous ) writes : > > Does anyone have any other suggestions where the 42 came from ? > I don't know where Douglas Adams took it from , but I'm pretty sure he's > the one who launched it ( in the Guide ) .

It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs . Of course , a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace . The problem that I've run into though , is that when it creates a detailed trace , it produces WAY more points than are necessary . If I trace something manually , I use many less es points . The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down , especially printing .

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics . I'm not sure if reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not . I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests , queued on a mailbox , one at a time . If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics library . Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something , what do you think ?

Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association " Spectrum " offer VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC / AT , wich include software and set of controllers . SOFTWARE For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed . Kit includes more then 200 different functions for image processing . Kit works in the interactive regime , and has include Help for non professional users . There are next possibility : - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family ; - read - white image to - from disk ; - print image on the printer ; - makes arithmetic with 2 frames ; - filter image ; - work with gistogramme ; - edit image . - include users exe modules . CONTROLLER VS9 The function of VS - 9 controller is to load TV-images into PC / AT . VS - 9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from a field of 724x600 pixels . The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image . This provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal and vertical directions . The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256 . Video signal capture time - 2.5 s . CONTROLLER VS52 The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM PC AT or any other machine of that type . The controller was created on the base of modern elements , including user programmable gate arrays . The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different resolutions . Its flexible architecture makes possible to change technical parameters . Instead of TV signal one can process any other analog signal ( including signals from slow-speed scanning devices ) . The controller has the following technical characteristics : - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ; - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64 to 1024x512 pixels ; - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024 pixels ; - video signal capture time - 40 ms . - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024 pixels ; - number of gray level - 256 ; - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input / output lookup table ( LUT ); - possibility to realize " scroll " and " zoom " ; - 8 lines for external synchronization ( an input using external controlling signal ) ; - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog - digital converter ; - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor . One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the controller by reprogramming it . IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100 Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV signal in real time . It is possible digitize TV signal with 512 * 512 * 8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation with two images . Processor was created on the base of modern elements including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board for PC . Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512 * 512 * 8 format . It is possible to accumulate until 16 images . The processor has the following technical characteristics : - memory volume to 64 Mb ; - number of the gray level - 256 ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input / output lookup table ; - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference ; - image size from 256 * 256 to 8192 * 8192 ; - possibility color and black / white output ; - possibility input from slow-scan video sources .From : mabusj@nason110.its.rpi.edu ( Jasen M .

If anyone out there knows a way around this > I am all ears . I think one ( not ideal ) solution is to use the tracing utility ( can't remember the name , sorry ! ) included in the Corel Draw s / w pack . It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format . These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap . Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem ! BUT the slight problem with this , which makes the solution less than idea , is that the trace utility spits out many more points than are necessary to define the shapes being traced . Straight lines and curves are both traced as many short segments . So ... the SCODAL taking * much * longer to image . The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping out the extra points by hand using Corel . OUCH ! I've done it a few times :-] > ...

From 3DO , RJ Mical ( of Amiga / Lynx fame ) and Hal Josephson ( sp ? ) were there to talk about the machine and their plan . We got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec ( which was nice , very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft ) ... and a very high frame rate to boot ( like 30fps ) .

I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine ( I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit ) . The price of generality ... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies often , if ever . But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines .

Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard ( a summary of which hit this group about 2 weeks ago ) . Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS ( I know I wouldn't ) Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC , Mac , Amiga . I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it . Is there a color version of MGR for Linux ? I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it . Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ? I can't seem to send a message to the MGR channel without it bouncing . Does anyone have any other suggestions for a Linux based GUI BBS ?

Of course the chances of Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for . I think you may have left out a few important parameters . The polygons are all convex . They have less than N sides . ( you are drawing meshes walls doors etc . ) I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons . This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line . Complex ( figure 8 type polygons ) can be a bit trickier . The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made . Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons . > finding something like that are pretty remote , so I guess I'd need the source > with it .

I'm using Kochanek-Bartels splines ( as described in the SIGGRAPH ' 84 proceedings ) to create a variable number of inbetweens between the key frames . I want the inbetweens to be given in the form ( x , y , z , dx , dy , dz ) where the last three argumentsa are the x , y and z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when positioned at ( x , y , z ) . The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the positions of the inbetween view points to be generated . I've tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points ( which in general are not key frames ) , but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions ( although the spatial movement seems to work fine ; and I'm quite certain - I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation error ... ) Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors .

Hi everyone , I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups : * * * Announcing the release of Multiverse -1.0 . 2 * * * Multiverse is a multi-user , non-immersive , X-Windows based Virtual Reality system , primarily focused on entertainment / research . Features : Client-Server based model , using Berkeley Sockets . No limit to the number of users ( apart from performance ) . Generic clients . Customizable servers . Hierachical Objects ( allowing attachment of cameras and light sources ) . Multiple light sources ( ambient , point and spot ) . Objects can have extension code , to handle unique functionality , easily attached . Functionality : Client : The client is built around a ' fast ' render loop . Basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint . It also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users . The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world . This means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it . The adaptations , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the servers . This release of the client software supports the following functionality : o Hierarchical Objects ( with associated addressing ) o Multiple Light Sources and Types ( Ambient , Point and Spot ) o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading ( optional wireframe for faster frame rates ) o Mouse and Keyboard Input ( Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't , but because I don't have one ! This will , however , be one of the first enhancements ! ) Server ( s ): This is where customization can take place . The following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers : o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling This may not sound like much , but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally . Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality . This is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects : o Server Selectable Extension Installation : What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world . Basically you call the extension initialisers you want . o Event Handler Registration : When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to . ( Current events supported : INIT , MOVE , CHANGE , COLLIDE & TERMINATE ) o Collision Detection Registration : If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software . Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs . This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose . The following is all you need to make a World Server application : o Provide an initWorld function : This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported , plus any initialization you want to do . o Provide a positionObject function : This is where you determine where to place a new client . o Provide an installWorldObjects function : This is where you load the world ( . wld ) file for a new client . o Provide a getWorldType function : This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have . o Provide an animateWorld function : This is where you can go wild ! At a minimum you should let the objects move ( by calling a move function ) and let the server sleep for a bit ( to avoid outrunning the clients ) . That's all there is to it ! And to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers I've provided : generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines ( more complicated collision detection due to the stairs ! Will probably be improved with future versions ) dogfight - 72 lines Location : This software is located at the following site : ftp.u.washington.edu Directory : pub / virtual-worlds File : multiverse-1.0.2.tar . Z Futures : Client : o Texture mapping . o More realistic rendering : i . e . Z-Buffering ( or similar ) , Gouraud shading o HMD support . o Etc , etc ... Server : o Physical Modelling ( gravity , friction etc ) . o Enhanced Object Management / Interaction o Etc , etc ... Both : o Improved Comms ! ! ! I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software , unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation , and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified ! :-( I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it , and I would * LOVE * to add support for the PowerGlove ... and an HMD :-) ! ! Finally one major disclaimer : This is totally amateur code . By that I mean there is no support for this code other than what I , out the kindness of my heart , or you , out of pure desperation , provide . I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK ! Disclaimer over ! Of course if you love it , I would like to here from you . And anyone with POSITIVE contributions / criticisms is also encouraged to contact me . Anyone who hates it : > / dev / null ! * * * * * * And if anyone wants to let me do this for a living : you know where to write :-) ! * * * * * * Thanks , Robert . robert@acsc.com ^ ^ ^From : berger@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu ( David Berger ) Subject : Need some Graphics Help !

Here is a short description and some technical information , taken from the accompanying documentation : DMPEG V1 . 0 Public Domain MPEG decoder by Stefan Eckart 0 . Features = = = DMPEG / DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder / player for the PC : - decodes ( nearly ) the full MPEG video standard ( I , P , B frames , frame size up to at least 352x240 supported ) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding ( requires VGA ) - several dithering options : ordered dither , Floyd-Steinberg , grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS , 640KB RAM , no MS-Windows required - very compact ( small code / small data models , 16 bit arithmetic ) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs ... 4 . Technical information = = = The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [ 1 ] . The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [ 2 ] ( not quite the optimum , I know ) . Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D - IDCT ( sounds great , doesn't it ? ) , which turned out to be faster than a ' fast ' algorithm in this ( quite common ) case . Dithering is pretty standard . Main difference to the Berkeley decoder ( except for the fewer number of supported algorithms ) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors , the ( default ) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither . This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image ( I claim , judge yourself ) . Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to + / -0.25 ( instead of + / -0.5 ) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space . Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two , the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors . Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color , lying somewhere between the points of the display color space , is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation . This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes ( the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC ) . The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas .

From : cvadrmaz@vmsb.is.csupomona.edu Hello , I realize that this might be a FAQ but I have to ask since I don't get a change to read this newsgroup very often . Anyways for my senior project I need to convert an AutoCad file to a TIFF file . Please I don't need anyone telling me that the AutoCAD file is a vector file and the TIFF is a bit map since I have heard that about 100 times already I would just like to know if anyone knows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction .

OK , never heard of Cross filters , but Roberts , Prewitt and Sobel filters are standard spatial masks for edge detection . Highpass filtering does a good job of detecting edges , too .

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion . Below is a very short description of the process which we use ; if you have further questions , feel free to poke me via e-mail . = = = * ASSUME : locally smooth distortion 0 ) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your ( x , y ) points . This defines the set of neighbors for each point . If your data are not naturally convex , you may have very long edges on the convex hull . Consider deleting these edges . 1 ) Now , there are two goals : a ) move the DistortedData ( x , y ) to the Reference ( x , y ) b ) keep the Length ( e ) ( as measured from the current ( x , y ) ' s ) as close as possible to the DigitizedLength ( e ) ( as measured using the digitized ( x , y ) ' s ) . 2 ) For every point , compute a displacement based on a ) and b ) . For example : a ) For ( x , y ) points for which you know the Reference ( x , y ) , you can move alpha 0 * ( Reference ( x , y ) - Current ( x , y ) ) . This will slowly move the DistortedReference ( x , y ) towards the Reference ( x , y ) . b ) For all other points , examine the current length of each edge . For each edge , compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length ( where " correct " is the DigitizedLength ) . Take the vector sum of these edge displacements , and move the point alpha 1 * SumOfEdgeDisplacements . This will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh . 3 ) Iterate 2 ) until you are happy ( for example , no point moves very much ) . alpha 0 and alpha 1 need to be determined by experimentation . Consider how much you believe the Reference ( x , y ) - i . e . , do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References , or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges . WARNING : there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed ( essentially , you can't allow the convex hull to change , and you can't allow triangles to " fold over " neighboring triangles . Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points , or by periodically re-triangulating the points ( using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions . When we first did this , the triangulation time was prohibitive , so we only did it once . If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years , I * might * go back and re-triangulate on every iteration . If you have more compute power than you know what to do with , you might consider having every point interact with every other point ... but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem . There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on springs , constraints , and energy calculations which are relevant . The above method is described , in more or less detail in : @inproceedings { Sloan 86 , author = " Sloan , Jr . , Kenneth R . and David Meyers and Christine A . ~ Curcio " , title = " Reconstruction and Display of the Retina " , booktitle = " Proceedings : Graphics Interface ' 86 Vision Interface ' 86 " , address = " Vancouver , Canada " , pages = " 385 - - 389 " , month = " May " , year = 1986 } @techreport { Curcio 87b , author = " Christine A . ~ Curcio and Kenneth R . ~ Sloan and David Meyers " , title = " Computer Methods for Sampling , Reconstruction , Display , and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts " , number = " TR 87-12- 03 " , institution = " Department of Computer Science , University of Washington " , address = " Seattle , WA " , month = " December " , year = 1987 } @article { Curcio 89 , author = " Christine A . ~ Curcio and Kenneth R . ~ Sloan and David Meyers " , title = " Computer Methods for Sampling , Reconstruction , Display , and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts " , journal = " Vision Research " , volume = 29 , number = 5 , pages = " 529 - - 540 " , year = 1989 } - - Kenneth Sloan Computer and Information Sciences sloan@cis.uab.edu University of Alabama at Birmingham (205) 934-2213 115A Campbell Hall , UAB Station (205) 934-5473 FAX Birmingham , AL 35294-1170From : pinky@tamu.edu ( The Man behind The Curtain ) Subject : Views on isomorphic perspectives ? I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective , similar to that used in Populous . Basically , you look into a room that looks similar to the following : xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx 2 xxxx 1 xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx 3 / | \ xxxx xxxx / ~ \ xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision . [ * ] Since your viewpoint is always the same , the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage . In my case , wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4 . ( I'm also using Mode X , 320x240 ) . I've run into two problems ; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before , and have perhaps formulated their own opinions : 1 ) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial , but when I ran a packed -> planar image through them , I was dismayed by the " jaggies . " I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines ( speed is not really necessary ) . Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed , thus being assured of nice image , or is this too much of a burden ? 2 ) Wall 3 presents a problem ; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original . I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where , and failed . Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape ? Currently I take : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 and produce : 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 Line 1 follows the slope . Line 2 is directly under line 1 . Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels . Line 4 is under line 3 . This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels . But it causes distortions . Has anyone come up with a better way ? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed ? Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective ? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering . Locations are stored in ( x , y , z ) form . [ * ] For those of you who noticed , the top lines of wall 2 ( and wall 1 ) * are * parallel with its bottom lines . This is why there appears to be an optical illusion ( ie . it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube , depending on your mood ) . There are no vanishing points . This simplifies the drawing code for objects ( which don't have to change size as they move about in the room ) . I've decided that this approximation is alright , since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing . Hopefully the " context " of the picture ( ie . chairs on the floor , torches hanging on the walls ) will dispell any visual ambiguity .

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators . It's quite fast ( I have 7 ) , but as usual with new boards / chips the drivers are buggy for Windows .

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies . Apparently the process of expanding each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processor-intensive . There are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size , but if you drop to 1.9 x size or increase to 2.1 x size , performance suffers dramatically . > Then I asked him what Mac he was using ... He was using a Quadra ( don't know > what model , 900 ? ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime > could play back at the same speed even on an LCII . He lied . :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent . He was probably confused by the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode , and will play in the same amount of time on any machine . However , an LC will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up . The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar performance , though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture . > Well , I spoiled his claim so to say , since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having > a little bit of trouble .

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 - - I was using was 1.5 . One of the new codecs in v1 . 5 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle . The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla , with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound , and the software was Movie Player , the QT player Apple includes with the software . > Don't misunderstand me , I just want to clarify this .

ThanksFrom : ldo@waikato.ac.nz ( Lawrence D'Oliveiro , Waikato University ) Subject : QuickTime performance ( was Re : Rumours about 3DO ? ? ? ) OK , with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime , the effects of scaling and so on , I thought I'd do some more tests . First of all , I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic . The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it ( it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor ) . I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results ( for better or for worse ) . I pulled out a copy of " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " that I had recorded off TV a while back . About fifteen minutes into the movie , there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station . Specifically , I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds ' duration , zooming in on the rotating space station . I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames . To increase the differences between frames , I digitized it at only 5 frames per second , to give a total of 171 frames . I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384 * 288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 ( quarter-size resolution from a PAL source ) . I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor , keeping the 5 fps frame rate . I created two versions of the movie : one scaled to 320 * 240 resolution , the other at 160 * 120 resolution . I used the default " 2.00 " quality setting in Premiere 2.0 . 1 , and specified a key frame every ten frames . I then ran the 320 * 240 movie through the same " Raw Speed Test " program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier . Result : a playback rate of over 45 frames per second . That's right , I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie . Just for fun , I copied the 320 * 240 movie to my external hard disk ( a Quantum LP105S ) , and ran it from there . This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second . Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk ( also a Quantum ) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback . I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors , and tried playing back the 160 * 120 movie scaled to 320 * 240 size . This time the playback speed was over 60 fps . Clearly , the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0 , but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1 ... Unscaled , the playback rate for the 160 * 120 movie was over 100 fps . The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320 * 240 movie with " preferred " playback rates greater than 1.0 , and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer ( ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback ) . A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps ) didn't work too well : the playback was very jerky . Compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with ease . I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead : I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching . A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps ) seemed to work fine : I couldn't see any evidence of stutter . At 8.0 (=> 40 fps ) I * think * I could see slight stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard to tell . I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames , to make the stutter more noticeable . Of course , this will also improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance even more ...

I'm thinking to treat the raw data .. not > compressed . Actually , for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than you need , unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV . Also , my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB , even using 24 bits / pixel ( which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for a moving picture ) . 1600x1100x16bits is 3.5 MB ( I'm guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600 , I'm fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals ) . I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB / s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system .

The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond . That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one previous poster's words , ' to fill a niche ' to compete with some other vendor . I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years . And every time I look at it , I'm going to think about SGI and how I could have better spent my money ( actually * your * money , since we're supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars ) . Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a corner somewhere and think dark , libelous thoughts . spl - - Steve Lamont , SciViGuy - - (619) 534-7968 - - spl@szechuan.ucsd.edu San Diego Microscopy and Imaging Resource / UC San Diego / La Jolla , CA 92093-0608 " My other car is a car , too .

I'm thinking to treat the raw data .. not > compressed . Finding a disk array that can do 180MB / sec . will be difficult . The fastest ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy ( IBM also sells these ) . They can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB / sec . ( 64 bit ) . For these kinds of data rates you need more than SCSI for connections . Their latest model , the RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB / sec . but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster . They are also not idle ( must be working on newer products that might be faster ) and are a small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces . They still marketed the older , faster model as of a few mongths ago . Maximum Strategy , Inc . 801 Buckeye Court Milpitas , CA 95035-7408 sales@maxstrat.com You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput might come close to maximum burst rate .

JPEG ( pronounced " jay-peg " ) is a standardized image compression mechanism . JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group , the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of " natural " , real-world scenes . It does not work so well on non-realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings . JPEG does not handle black-and-white ( 1 - bit-per-pixel ) images , nor does it handle motion picture compression . Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees , named JBIG and MPEG respectively . JPEG is " lossy " , meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in . The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark . Thus , JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans . If you plan to machine-analyze your images , the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you , even if they are invisible to the eye . A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters . This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality . You can make * extremely * small files if you don't mind poor quality ; this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc . etc . Conversely , if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression . [ 2 ] Why use JPEG ? There are two good reasons : to make your image files smaller , and to store 24 - bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8 - bit-per-pixel data . Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images . Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time ! ( If you are comparing GIF and JPEG , the size ratio is more like four to one . More details below . ) If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly , you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images . Even with a JPEG-capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format ( GIF , for instance ) . Thus , using JPEG is essentially a time / space tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply . It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself . The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information : 24 bits / pixel ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer colors ) . If you have only 8 - bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you . Within a couple of years , though , 8 - bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today . Furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware . Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard . [ 3 ] When should I use JPEG , and when should I stick with GIF ? JPEG is * not * going to displace GIF entirely ; for some types of images , GIF is superior in image quality , file size , or both . One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to . As a rule of thumb , JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of " realistic " scenes ; that means scanned photographs and similar material . JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24 - bit display hardware , and it is a LOT superior if you do . ( See section 7 for details . ) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors , such as cartoons and line drawings . In particular , large areas of pixels that are all * exactly * the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF . JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects . This sort of image is best kept in GIF form . ( In particular , single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files , but they should be avoided in JPEG files . ) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges : a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels , for example . Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting . Again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in GIF files : borders , overlaid text , etc . The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high . If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text , don't JPEG it . Computer-drawn images ( ray-traced scenes , for instance ) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity . The more complex and subtly rendered the image , the more likely that JPEG will do well on it . The same goes for semi-realistic artwork ( fantasy drawings and such ) . Plain black-and-white ( two level ) images should never be converted to JPEG . You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images . It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels , while JPEG is not . If you have an existing library of GIF images , you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG . You will lose a little image quality if you do . ( Section 7 , which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF , only applies if both formats start from a full-color original . If you start from a GIF , you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information ; JPEG can only make things worse . ) However , the disk space savings may justify converting anyway . This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself . If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG , see section 14 for hints . Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format , since some GIFs will not convert well . [ 4 ] How well does JPEG compress images ? Pretty darn well . Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor . The first three files are for comparison purposes ; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B . File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format ( no compression ; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead ) ship.ppm . Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish a lot , you'll note . Other text-oriented compressors give similar results . ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant - fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info : GIF saves 8 bits / pixel , not 24 . ( See sec . 7 . ) ship . jpg 95 155622 cjpeg - Q 95 ( highest useful quality setting ) This is indistinguishable from the 24 - bit original , at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs . ship . jpg 75 58009 cjpeg - Q 75 ( default setting ) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original , even with both on-screen at once . ship . jpg 50 38406 cjpeg - Q 50 This has slight defects ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing the original . Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups . ship . jpg 25 25192 cjpeg - Q 25 JPEG's characteristic " blockiness " becomes apparent at this setting ( djpeg - blocksmooth helps some ) . Still , I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this . ship . jpg 5o 6587 cjpeg - Q 5 - optimize ( - optimize cuts table overhead ) Blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes . Note that this file is TINY : the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality ( the - Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF , better if you have a full-color display ) . This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes . [ 5 ] What are good " quality " settings for JPEG ? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs . image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting . There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings . " Quality 95 " does NOT mean " keep 95 % of the information " , as some have claimed . The quality scale is purely arbitrary ; it's not a percentage of anything . The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting ( smallest file size ) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original . This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb . The default quality setting ( - Q 75 ) is very often the best choice . This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image . Try - Q 75 first ; if you see defects , then go up . Except for experimental purposes , never go above - Q 95 ; saying - Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as - Q 95 , but of hardly any better quality . If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to go down to - Q 50 without objectionable degradation . On the other hand , you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation . The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG . The default - Q 75 is about right for compressing 24 - bit images , but - Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs ( see section 14 for more info ) . If you want a very small file ( say for preview or indexing purposes ) and are prepared to tolerate large defects , a - Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right . - Q 2 or so may be amusing as " op art " . ( Note : the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B , and to many programs based on it . Other JPEG implementations , such as Image Alchemy , may use a completely different quality scale . Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale , just " high " / " medium " / " low " - style choices . ) [ 6 ] Where can I get JPEG software ? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP . If you don't know how to use FTP , see the FAQ article " How to find sources " . ( If you don't have direct access to FTP , read about ftpmail servers in the same article . ) That article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with " send usenet / news.answers/finding-sources " in the body . The " Anonymous FTP List FAQ " may also be helpful - - - it's usenet / news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive . NOTE : this list changes constantly . If you have a copy more than a couple months old , get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive . [ 6A ] If you are looking for " canned " software , viewers , etc : The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system . If you don't see what you want for your machine , check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list . Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet ; but some commercial programs are listed too . X Windows : XV ( shareware , $ 25 ) is an excellent viewer for JPEG , GIF , and many other image formats . It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations . It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24 . 0.12 ) , file contrib / xv-3.00.tar . Z . Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24 - bit displays and many other improvements ; however , it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking . If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export . Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24 - bit display ( you'll get only 8 - bit color ) , nor for converting 24 - bit images to JPEG . But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8 - bit images to JPEG . CAUTION : there is a glitch in version 2.21 : be sure to check the " save at normal size " checkbox when saving a JPEG file , or the file will be blurry . Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package , also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib / ImageMagick.tar . Z . This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks . The ImageMagick viewer handles 24 - bit displays correctly ; for colormapped displays , it does better ( though slower ) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software . Both of the above are large , complex packages . If you just want a simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli . xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release , 3.03 . xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib / xloadimage-3.03.tar . Z . xli is a variant version of xloadimage , said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original . ( The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage , at least with respect to JPEG files , because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 . The next xloadimage release will fix this . ) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib / xli.1.14.tar . Z . Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24 - bit displays . MS-DOS : This covers plain DOS ; for Windows or OS / 2 programs , see the next headings . One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG , which views JPEG and GIF files . The current version , 2.5 , is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97 . 50.50 ) , file pub / jpeg / viewers / dvpeg25.zip . This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines . The user interface is not flashy , but it's functional . Another freeware JPEG / GIF / TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview . The current version , 1.2 , is available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / hv12.zip . Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager ( QEMM 386 and 386MAX work ; Windows and OS / 2 do not ) . Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen . For larger images , it scales the image down to fit on the screen ( rather than using panning / scrolling as most viewers do ) . You may or may not prefer this approach , but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably . Note : installation is a bit tricky ; read the directions carefully ! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ( $ 30 ) . This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives . Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking , although personally I find it harder to use - - - more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior . It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview , at least on my hardware . ( For images larger than screen size , DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than Hiview . ) The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / dcview21.zip . Requires a VESA graphics driver ; if you don't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory . ( Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver , so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing . ) A second shareware alternative is Fullview , which has been kicking around the net for a while , but I don't know any stable archive location for it . The current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway . The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel 20 archives at that time . The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow ( CSHOW ) supports JPEG in its latest revision , 8.60 a . However , CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good : it's slow ( about half the speed of the above viewers ) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays . Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW . Shareware , $ 25 . Available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / gif / cshw860a.zip . Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware , any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine . If you can't get * any * of them to work , you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF , then view with your favorite GIF viewer . ( If you have hi-color hardware , don't use GIF as the intermediate format ; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead . VPIC 5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays . ) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory ) . These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B ; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF , Targa , and PPM formats . Handmade Software offers free JPEG <=> GIF conversion tools , GIF 2JPG / JPG 2GIF . These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format ; in particular , you can't get 24 - bit color output from a JPEG . The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes , this is a useful capability . Version 2.0 of these tools is free ( prior versions were shareware ) . Get it from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / gif2jpg2.zip . NOTE : do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet , since it is not readable on non-PC platforms . Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package , Image Alchemy . This will translate JPEG files ( both JFIF and HSI formats ) to and from many other image formats . It can also display images . A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6 . 2 is available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / alch162.zip . NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL 20 : The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel 20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88 . 110.20 ) . Simtel 20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names ; where this document refers to directory ( eg ) " msdos / graphics " at Simtel 20 , that really means " pd1 : <msdos.graphics> " . If you are not physically on MILnet , you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel 20 . There are several Internet sites that maintain copies ( mirrors ) of the Simtel 20 archives ; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead . A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210 . 10.117 ) , which keeps Simtel 20 files in ( eg ) " / pub / msdos / graphics " . If you have no FTP capability , you can retrieve files from Simtel 20 by e-mail ; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how . If you are outside the USA , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel 20 mirror is . Microsoft Windows : There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images . ( Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware , due to Windows ' system overhead . Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window . ) The newest entry is WinECJ , which is free and EXTREMELY fast . Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net , file / pub / bryanw / pc / jpeg / wecj.zip . Requires Windows 3.1 and 256 - or-more-colors mode . This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes ; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers . But it's so fast you'll use it anyway , at least for previewing ... JView is freeware , fairly fast , has good on-line help , and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format ; but it can't create new JPEG files , and it doesn't view GIFs . JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers ( such as brightness adjustment ) , but it's an excellent basic viewer . The current version , 0.9 , is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( 129.79 . 20.84 ) , file pub / pc / win 3 / desktop / jview090.zip . ( Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites , including wuarchive.wustl.edu . ) WinJPEG ( shareware , $ 20 ) displays JPEG , GIF , Targa , TIFF , and BMP image files ; it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter . It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow . The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos / windows 3 / winjp210.zip . ( This is a slow 286 - compatible version ; if you register , you'll get the 386 - only version , which is roughly 25 % faster . ) ColorView is another shareware entry ( $ 30 ) . This was an early and promising contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG . If you want to try it anyway , the current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file pub / pc / win 3 / desktop / cview097.zip . ( I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS . ) DVPEG ( see DOS heading ) also works under Windows , but only in full-screen mode , not in a window . OS / 2 : The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu ( 128.123 . 35.151 ) . Note : check / pub / uploads for more recent versions - - - the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / jpegv4.zip 32 - bit version of free IJG conversion programs , version 4 . / pub / os2 / all / graphics / jpeg4-16.zip 16 - bit version of same , for OS / 2 1 . x . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02 : image conversion / viewing with PM graphical interface . Strong on conversion functions , viewing is a bit weaker . Shareware , $ 15 . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1 : OS / 2 2 . x port of WinJPEG , a popular viewer for Windows ( see description in Windows section ) . Shareware , $ 20 . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / pmview85.zip PMView 0.85 : JPEG / GIF / BMP / Targa / PCX viewer . GIF viewing very fast , JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs . Has image manipulation & slideshow functions . Shareware , $ 20 . Macintosh : Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation , which is part of the QuickTime system extension ; so you need to have QuickTime installed . To use QuickTime , you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0 . 7 or later . ( If you're running System 6 , you must also install the 32 - bit QuickDraw extension ; this is built-in on System 7 . ) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com , file dts / mac / quicktime / quicktime.hqx . ( As of 11/92 , this file contains QuickTime 1.5 , which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways . With respect to JPEG , it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file . However , some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5 . ) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format , PICT / JPEG , is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format . ( See section 10 for details . ) If you post images on Usenet , make sure they are in JFIF format . Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format . The first choice is probably JPEGView , a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format , PICT / JPEG format , or GIF format . It also can convert between the two JPEG formats . The current version , 2.0 , is a big improvement over prior versions . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44 . 0.6 ) , file / info-mac / app / jpeg-view-20.hqx . Requires System 7 and QuickTime . On 8 - bit displays , JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers . JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers ; in fact , it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac . Given a large image , JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers . ( You can zoom in on any desired portion , though . ) Some people like this behavior , some don't . Overall , JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out . GIFConverter , a shareware ( $ 40 ) image viewer / converter , supports JFIF and PICT / JPEG , as well as GIF and several other image formats . The latest version is 2.3 . 2 . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file / info-mac / art / gif / gif-converter-232.hqx . Requires System 6.0 . 5 or later . GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG / GIF viewer , but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images . Also , the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images * without * QuickTime , so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime . ( But it's faster with QuickTime . ) Note : If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG , try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert , then viewing the GIF version . JPEG Convert , a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities , is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file / info-mac / app / jpeg-convert-10.hqx . This will run on any Mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing . You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer . Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0 . 6 , a JPEG <=> GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code . If you are using this program , you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert . Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF , QuickTime JPEG , and GIF format , and can convert between these formats . You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com , file dts / mac / quicktime / qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . Requires QuickTime . PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool , and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime . Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 - bit display , and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface . Worse , PictPixie is an unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix . ( There is an old version of PictPixie , called PICTCompressor , floating around the net . If you have this you should trash it , as it's even buggier . Also , the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor . Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net . ) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer / converter . This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime , so you may be forced to use it on older systems . ( It does need 32 - bit QuickDraw , so really old machines can't use it . ) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file / info-mac / app / picture-decompress-201.hqx . You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to ' JPEG ' to allow Picture Decompress to open it . If your machine is too old to run 32 - bit QuickDraw ( a Mac Plus for instance ) , GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing . If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter , use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer . More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG , although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Adobe Photoshop , version 2.0 . 1 or later , can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files ( use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu ) . You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to ' JPEG ' to allow Photoshop to recognize it . Amiga : ( Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( 130.60 . 80.80 ) . There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one . In the USA , a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu ; look under / mirrors / amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... ) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer / converter , as well as being a general image manipulation tool . It's cheap ( shareware , $ 20 ) and can read several formats besides JPEG . The current version is 2.0 . 8 . A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga / gfx / edit / hamlab208d.lha . The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional . Rend 24 ( shareware , $ 30 ) is an image renderer that can display JPEG , ILBM , and GIF images . The program can be used to create animations , even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave . The current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga / os30 / gfx / rend105.lha . ( Note : although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs , the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1 . ) Viewtek is a free JPEG / ILBM / GIF / ANIM viewer . The current version is 1.04 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga / gfx / show / ViewTek104.lha . If you're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages that support JPEG . Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel , the author of Rend 24 and Viewtek . These are CineMorph , a standalone image morphing package , and ImageFX , an impressive 24 - bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting , effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph . Both are distributed by Great Valley Products . Art Department Professional ( ADPro ) , from ASDG Inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas . ImageMaster , from Black Belt Systems , is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support . The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) in directory amiga / gfx / conv , file AmigaJPEGV4.lha . These programs convert JPEG to / from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs , many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software ( thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month , without so much as notifying the authors ) . Among these are " AugJPEG " , " NewAmyJPEG " , " VJPEG " , and probably others I have not even heard of . In my opinion , anything older than IJG version 3 ( March 1992 ) is not worth the disk space it's stored on ; if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer . Atari ST : The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST , TT , etc , from atari.archive.umich.edu , file / atari / Graphics / jpeg4bin.zoo . These programs convert JPEG to / from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . For monochrome ST monitors , try MGIF , which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering . Version 4.1 reads JPEG files . Available from atari.archive.umich.edu , file / atari / Graphics / mgif41b.zoo . I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris , but surely there must be some by now ? Pointers appreciated . Acorn Archimedes : ! ChangeFSI , supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format . Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG , although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking . Recent versions ( since 7.11 ) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG , along with about 30 other image formats . While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by registering with the author , John Kortink , Nutterbrink 31 , 7544 WJ , Enschede , The Netherlands . Price 35 Dutch guilders ( about $ 22 or 10 pounds ) . There's also a commercial product called ! JPEG which provides JPEG read / write functionality and direct JPEG viewing , as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options . This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs . Contact : DT Software , FREEPOST , Cambridge , UK . Tel : 0223 8410 99 . NeXT : ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions . The current version reads JPEG but does not write it . ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu , somewhere in / pub / next ( both are currently being re-organized , so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories ) . Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG . Portable software for almost any system : If none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B . You'll also need a viewer program . If your display is 8 bits or less , any GIF viewer will do fine ; if you have a display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24 - bit image files . There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings , with more popping up every day . I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow . In that case , purchase a hardware-assisted product . Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format ; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files . [ 6B ] If you are looking for source code to work with : Free , portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group , which I lead . A package containing our source code , documentation , and some small test files is available from several places . The " official " archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net ( 137.39 . 1.9 or 192.48 . 96.9 ) . Look under directory / graphics / jpeg ; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar . Z . ( This is a compressed TAR file ; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode . ) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP . If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with . tar . Z format , you may prefer ZIP format , which you can find at Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos / graphics / jpegsrc4.zip . This file will also be available on CompuServe , in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum ( GO PICS ) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip . If you have no FTP access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive ; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34 . ( If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the FAQ article " How to find sources " , referred to at the top of section 6 . ) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG " JFIF " format and image files in GIF , PBMPLUS PPM / PGM , Utah RLE , and Truevision Targa file formats . The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs , such as image viewers . The package is highly portable ; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays . We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use . Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products . We do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature ( see the README file in the distribution for details ) . We hope to make this software industrial-quality - - - although , as with anything that's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability .

Most people don't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardware . Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time . To display a full-color image , the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors . This process is called " color quantization " . ( This is something of a misnomer , " color selection " would be a better term . We're stuck with the standard usage though . ) Clearly , color quantization is a lossy process . It turns out that for most images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG ( except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings ) . Since JPEG is a full-color format , converting a color JPEG image for display on 8 - bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization . This is true for * all * color JPEGs : even if you feed a 256 - or-less-color GIF into JPEG , what comes out of the decompressor is * not * 256 colors , but thousands of colors . This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors . Each original color gets " smeared " into a group of nearby colors . Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display , regardless of the image source . The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output . ( Incidentally , because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image . Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values , different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences . I occasionally see posted images described as " 256 - color JPEG " . This tells me that the poster ( a ) hasn't read this FAQ and ( b ) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF . JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale ( just like photographs ) , but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG . ) On the other hand , a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors . ( A GIF * does * have a definite number of colors in its palette , and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries . ) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution , GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients don't have to . This is also the * disadvantage * of GIF : you're stuck with the sender's quantization . If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display , you have to re-quantize , resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image . Furthermore , if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm , you're out of luck . For this reason , JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware . JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware . Furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms ( there is a lot of active research in this area ) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of JPEG images you already have . With a GIF , you're stuck forevermore with what was sent . It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines . If you view a 256 - color GIF on a 16 - color EGA display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to . This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations ( one to create the GIF , one to display it ) , but often it's also due to sloppiness . JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed . Thus , JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones ! Finally , an ever-growing number of people have better-than - 8 - bit display hardware already : 15 - bit " hi-color " PC displays , true 24 - bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes , etc . For these people , GIF is already obsolete , as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display . JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively . Thus , JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion . [8 ] How does JPEG work ? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine transforms , coefficient quantization , and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding . This article's long enough already , so I'm not going to say more than that here . For technical information , see the comp.compression FAQ . This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files / pub / usenet / news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . If you need help in using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article . [ 9 ] What about lossless JPEG ? There's a great deal of confusion on this subject . The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i . e . , one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input . However , this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy JPEG algorithm , and it offers much less compression . At present , very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist , and all of them are commercial . Saying " - Q 100 " to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image . What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step . There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step . ( With the V4 free JPEG code , you can also say " - sample 1x1 " to turn off subsampling . Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file . ) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations . The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value ; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image . At this minimum-loss setting , regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 - bit-per-pixel image . True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy . If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel ( per color component ) , you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard . This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images . JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel ; furthermore , JPEG is public domain ( at least with a Huffman back end ) , while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents . [ 10 ] Why all the argument about file formats ? Strictly speaking , JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms ; it does * not * refer to a specific image file format . The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations . Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format , this leaves us with a problem . In the absence of official standards , a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to " do their own thing " , and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's . The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems . They have defined two JPEG-based file formats : * JFIF ( JPEG File Interchange Format ) , a " low-end " format that transports pixels and not much else . * TIFF / JPEG , aka TIFF 6.0 , an extension of the Aldus TIFF format . TIFF is a " high-end " format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides :-) . TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF , and may well prove less transportable , because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF . It's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation . Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products ; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards . I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings . JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now ; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details . Even when TIFF / JPEG is well defined , the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported " lowest common denominator " ; TIFF / JPEG files may never be as transportable . A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh . QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure . Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward , and several Mac programs are available to do it ( see Mac portion of section 6A ) . If you have an editor that handles binary files , you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand ; see section 11 for details . Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs ( GIF 2JPG / JPG 2GIF and Image Alchemy ) . These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format . By default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by HSI . This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings . Use the - j switch to get JFIF output . ( This applies to old versions of these programs ; the current releases emit JFIF format by default . You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms . ) [ 11 ] How do I recognize which file format I have , and what do I do about it ? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read , it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format . You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file : 1 . A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters ( hex ) FF D8 FF E0 , followed by two variable bytes ( often hex 00 10 ) , followed by ' JFIF ' . 2 . If you see FF D8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a " raw JPEG " file . This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software - - - it's worth a try , anyway . 3 . HSI files start with ' hsi 1 ' . You're out of luck unless you have HSI software . Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data , but they won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs . 4 . A Macintosh PICT file , if JPEG-compressed , will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header ( scan for ' JFIF ' ) . Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it . 5 . Anything else : it's a proprietary format , or not JPEG at all . If you are lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream . If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream ( look for FF D8 ) , try stripping off everything before that . In uuencoded Usenet postings , the characteristic JFIF pattern is " begin " line M_ ] C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with " begin " line M : ' - I ... If you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files . [ 12 ] What about arithmetic coding ? The JPEG spec defines two different " back end " modules for the final output of compressed data : either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed . The choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file . On typical images , arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding . ( All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding . ) Unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM , AT & T , and Mitsubishi . Thus * you cannot legally use arithmetic coding * unless you obtain licenses from these companies . ( The " fair use " doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best . ) At least in the short run , I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding ; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles . In particular , arithmetic coding * should not * be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet . There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future . Stay tuned for further details . [ 13 ] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression / decompression ? It would be nice if , having compressed an image with JPEG , you could decompress it , manipulate it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially . Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE . In general , recompressing an altered image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the first time around . The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it * without changing it * then there is no further loss , i . e . , you get an identical JPEG file . Even this is not true ; at least , not with the current free JPEG software . It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error . If you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output . ( It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change . ) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited , but I am not optimistic about it . In any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg , at the original quality setting , would introduce no further loss . Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation . ( If you're wondering why , it's because the pixel-block boundaries move . If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but that's a mighty limited capability ! ) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images , but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps . Use a lossless format ( PPM , RLE , TIFF , etc ) while working on the image , then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away . Aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot of compression / decompression time this way :-) . [ 14 ] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG ? As stated earlier , you * will * lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG . If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from , it's far better to make a JPEG from that . But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from , here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality . The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG , to make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding GIF ; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary . Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs , as explained in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well . You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be * larger * than the GIF . ( So check the sizes too . ) Experience to date suggests that large , high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG . They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings , and they convert to JPEG with least degradation . Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes . Also , don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals . To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be ( i . e . , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3 rd the size of the GIF file , not 1/4 th as suggested in earlier comparisons ) . Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image . While useless , this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files . It is NOT free in JPEG files , and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ( " ghost " edges ) . Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing . ( If you are on an X Windows system , XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this . ) cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input , but for GIF inputs , Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation . ( If you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher Q setting may not be necessary . ) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually " dithered " to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store . If you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors ; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value . The trouble with dithering is that , to JPEG , it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise ; and JPEG can't compress noise very well . The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image ( if you had it ) . To get around this , you want to " smooth " the GIF image before compression . Smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble . Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor , thus further reducing the size of the compressed file , while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing . With the V4 free JPEG software ( or products based on it ) , a simple smoothing capability is built in . Try " - smooth 10 " or so when converting GIFs . Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs . Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors . ( If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement , then strong smoothing is definitely called for . ) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image , which you don't want . If you are an image processing wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package . However , cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol ... The upshot of all this is that " cjpeg - quality 85 - smooth 10 " is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs . But if you really care about the image , you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings . - - - For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular , contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net . - - tom lane organizer , Independent JPEG Group Internet : tgl@cs.cmu.edu BITNET : tgl % cs.cmu . edu @carnegieFrom : renes@ecpdsharmony.cern.ch ( Rene S .

"From : boebert@sctc.com ( Earl Boebert ) Subject : Removing Distortion From Bitmapped Drawings ? Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing ; in this case a boat , but it could be anything . On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x , y positions are known . Now you digitize the drawing manually ( in this case , using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program ) . That is , you use a program which converts cursor positions to x , y and saves those values when you click the mouse . Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values . This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper , errors introduced in the printing process , scanner errors and what have you . The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing , so " global " adjustments such as stretching / contracting uniformly over x or y , or rotating the whole drawing , are not satisfactory . So the question is : does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion ? In particular , if I have three sets of points Reference ( x , y ) ( the known true values ) DistortedReference ( x , y ) ( the same points , with known errors ) DistortedData ( x , y ) ( other points , with unknown errors ) what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors . I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a " bumpy " 3d surface , solving for the surface and then " flattening " it to remove the errors in the other data points . Any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas , or better yet , pointers to treatments of the same or similar problems ?

Look for edge inconsistencies . Consider two vertices , p and q , which are connected by at least one edge . If ( p , q ) is an edge , then ( q , p ) should * not * appear . If * both * ( p , q ) and ( q , p ) appear as edges , then the surface " flips " when you travel across that edge . This is bad .

Flip those which are wrong .

That's a typical claim , though they say they've improved compression speed considerably . Did you find out anything else about the book ?

Since this was posted on comp.ai , I assume there is an AI angle to this . Hacking is what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else , e . g . thesis research & write up , getting their supervisors ' pet programs to run properly , etc . No-one gets much glory for hacking , and no-one gets any money out of it . Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can , or want to , afford - particularly during a recession . In addition , over the last 10 years , I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research , and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving . Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs . At a conference a year or two ago , Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should ' Get back to the keyboard ' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I'm inclined to agree .

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little > time as possible . I need this for use in a forward raytracing > program . I think that this is a very difficult problem . To start with , lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points . Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas . First , we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated . Now , the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open ( and thus non-compact ) regions . Thus , the line lies completely inside the polygon , the line lies completely outside the polygon , or possibly ( but this will rarely happen ) the line intersects the polyon . Now , the phrasing of this question says " if a line intersects a polygon " , so this is a decision problem . One possibility ( the decision model approach ) is to reduce the question to some other ( well known ) problem Q , and then try to solve Q . An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem . In recent years , many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript . ( See " PostScript Language " , by Adobe Systems Incorporated , ISBN # 0-201-1017 9-3 , co . 1985 ) . So , given a line L and a polygon P , we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P , and then " outputs " the answer . By " output " , we mean the program executes a command called " showpage " , which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon . A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q , and thus the original problem . There are two small problems with this approach . ( 1 ) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the reduced problem Q . So , we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice ( or equivalently , Zorn's Lemma ) . But the use of the Axiom of Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days . ( 2 ) More importantly , the question arises as to whether or not the PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper ; or in other words , will it halt ? Now , PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem ( for PostScript ) is undecidable . It is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable . I won't even begin to go into other difficulties , such as aliasing , finite precision and running out of ink , paper or both . A couple of references might be : 1 . Principia Mathematica . Newton , I . Cambridge University Press , Cambridge , England . ( Sorry , I don't have an ISBN # for this ) . 2 . An Introduction to Automata Theory , Languages , and Computation .

Organization : AT & T Bell Laboratories , Murray Hill NJ The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests ( he should know better , he's hung around The Labs for long enough ) . By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction ( see J . Dullman & D . Dobbin , J . Comp . Obfusc . 37 , ii : pp . 33-947 , lemma 17 ( a ) ) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit , without ( ! ) the use of Grobner bases , so LPI ( to coin an acronym ) is probably only NP-complete . Besides , Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray - 3 is delivered , since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds ( with scatter-gather . ) - - - From : deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu ( David Baraff ) Well , sure its no worse than NP-complete , but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative . ( I think there's an ' 89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this ) . - - - - - J o n a s Y n g v e s s o n email : jonas-y@isy.liu.se Dept . of Electrical Engineering voice : + 46 - ( 0 ) 13-282162 University of Linkoping , Sweden fax : + 46 - ( 0 ) 13-139282From : grieggs@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov ( John T .

A list of computer graphics , computational geometry and image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia , jk87377@cs.tut.fi . 2 ) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen . The simple answer is , you divide by the depth . For a more verbose explanation , see any of the above references , starting with : The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes " Computer Graphics " book is certainly a good start . Chapter 6 is " Viewing in 3D " , then read chapter 15 , " Visible-Surface Determination " . For more information go to chapter 16 for shading , chapter 19 for clipping , and branch out from there . 3 ) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits . Find a copy of " Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display " by Paul Heckbert , SIGGRAPH ' 82 Proceedings , page 297 . There are other algorithms , but this one works well and is fairly simple . Implementations are included in most raster toolkits ( see item 7 below ) . A variant method is described in " Graphics Gems " , p . 287-293 . Note that the code from the " Graphics Gems " series is all available from an FTP site , as described above . Check out John Bradley's " Diversity Algorithm " , which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual . The ImageMagick package ( see section 7 for where it is ) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as " doing a better job than the other algorithms , but slower " . There's also an implementation of : Wan , Wong , and Prusinkiewicz , _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering _ , Transactions on Mathematical Software , Vol . 14 # 2 ( June , 1988 ) , pp . 153-162 . avialable as princeton.edu :p ub / Graphics / colorquant.shar . This code , in modified form , appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well . 4 ) Converting color into grayscale . The NTSC formula is : luminosity = . 299 red + . 587 green + . 114 blue 5 ) Quantizing grayscale to black & white . The only reference you need for this stuff is : Digital Halftoning , Robert Ulichney , MIT Press 1987 , ISBN 0-262-2100 9-6 But before you go off and start coding , check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below . All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b & w conversion . 6 ) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle . The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image , transform each coordinate , and copy the pixel to the destination . This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination . Instead , loop over the pixels in the destination image , apply the * reverse * transformation to the coordinates , and copy that pixel from the source . This method is quite general , and can be used for any one-to-one 2 - D mapping , not just rotation . You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling . However , there is a much faster method , with antialising included , which involves doing three shear operations . The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit ( see below ); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS . Reference : " A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation " , by Alan Paeth ( awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu ) Graphics Interface ' 86 ( Vancouver ) . An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal . An updated version of the rotation paper appears in " Graphics Gems " ( see section [ 1 ] ) under the original title . 7 ) Free image manipulation software . There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another , doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling , plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8 , color -> gray , gray -> b & w conversions . Here are pointers to some of them : xv by John Bradley . X-based image display , manipulation , and format conversion package .

" There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message . See item 13 below for details on some . Also , the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this . You may find useful information there . 8) Format documents for TIFF , IFF , BIFF , NFF , OFF , FITS , etc . You almost certainly don't need these . Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software . Get one or more of these packages and look through them . Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there . But if you still want one of the format documents , many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub / graphics.formats . These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct . This archive includes pixel formats , and two - and three-dimensional object formats . The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment , as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it . A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol ( koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu ) . The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in / misc / file.formats/graphics.formats . Apparently , neither of these is complete , you might want to check both . FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System . It's a file format most often used in astronomy . Despite the name , it can contain not only images but other things as well . There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more . 9 ) Converting between vector formats . A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript , or MacDraw to CGM , or whatever . It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7 . Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem , since once you get past all the file header junk , a pixel is a pixel - - the basic objects are the same for all image formats . This is not so for vector formats . The basic objects - - circles , ellipses , drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles , etc . - - vary from one format to another . Except in extremely restricted cases , it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats . There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu . The contributor states that it runs on Unix , MS-Windows , and possibly the Mac . A better , more specific blurb would be most welcome . On the other hand , it is quite possible to do a close approximation , rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another . As far as I know , no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters , but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc . Check the index on your nearest archive site . A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format , or HPGL to X11 bitmap . For example , some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer . Also , the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11 / NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever . But in general , the answer is no . However , if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit , adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial . GNU ghostscript ( from the FSF - current version 2.5 . 2 ) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files , thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter . ( It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2 ) . 10 ) How to get Pixar films .

Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international , 213-396-3233 FAX ) to charge to your credit card . Call first to verify prices and availability . Or , just write to : Direct Cinema Limited 1749 14th Street Santa Monica , CA 90404-4342 Allan Braunsdorf has this to say : At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $ 25 . That was a sale price . You can get it for slightly more than that normally . ( $ 35 maybe . ) I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail ( at Pixar's address ) . Pixar 1001 West Cutting Blvd . Richmond , CA . 94804 (510) 236-4000 (510) 236-0388 ( FAX ) You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains " Luxo , Jr . " , " Red's Dream " , " Tin Toy " and " Knicknack " for $ 25.00 , plus $ 2.50 for shipping . They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card . I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later . Don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store . According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case , it cannot be rented . 11 ) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier ( or B-spline ) curve ? The short answer is , " You can't . " Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle . The approximation may look acceptable , but it is sensitive to scale . Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies . Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large . If you want to do the job right , consult the article : " A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles " by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications , volume 9 , number 9 , September , 1989 , pages 48-56 . For rough , non-rational approximations , consult the book : Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I . D . Faux and M . J . Pratt , Ellis Horwood Publishers , Halsted Press , John Wiley 1980 . For the best known non-rational approximations , consult the article : " Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves " by Tor Dokken , Morten Daehlen , Tom Lyche , and Knut Morken in Computer Aided Geometric Design , volume 7 , numbers 1-4 ( combined ) , June , 1990 , pages 33-41 [ Elsevier Science Publishers ( North-Holland ) ] 12 ) How to order standards documents . The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards , and also ISO ( international ) standards . Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900 , mailing address is 1430 Broadway , NY NY 10018 . It helps if you have the complete name and number . Some useful numbers to know : CGM ( Computer Graphics Metafile ) is ISO 8632-4 ( 1987 ) . GKS ( Graphical Kernel System ) is ANSI X3 . 124-1985 . PHIGS ( Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System ) is ANSI X3 . 144-1988 . IGES is ASME / ANSI Y14 . 26M - 1987 . Language bindings are often separate but related numbers ; for example , the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3 . 124.1- 1985 . Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public ( this includes you ! ) . ANSI can let you know where to order them ; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179 . 13 ) How to FTP by email . There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system . You send a message to an automated server saying something like " send comp.sources.unix/fbm " , and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail . In addition , there is at least one FTP-by-mail server . Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying " help " and it will tell you how to use it . Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse . 14 ) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon . Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity . If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way , the point is within the polygon . If the ray crosses an even number of edges , the point is either outside the polygon , or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges . This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem ; see Eric Haines ' article in Glassner's ray tracing book ( above ) for more information , including treatment of special cases . Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon . If the sum is 2 pi , the point is inside , if the sum is 0 the point is outside . However , this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly . Code for both methods ( plus barycentric triangle testing ) can be found in the Ray Tracing News , Vol . 5 , No . 3 , available from princeton.edu : pub / Graphics / RTNews / RTNv 5n3 . Z . 15 ) How to tessellate a sphere . One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles . The base of the recursion is an octahedron , and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones . Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere . c that generates the coordinates . It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu . 16 ) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination . Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography : Highlights of this edition - i ) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through November ' 91 ; ii ) papers from all Siggraph , Graphics Interface , Eurographics , CG International and Ausgraph proceedings through December , ' 91 ; iii ) all citations keyworded for easy lookup ; iv ) cross-indices by keyword and author ; v ) glossary of the 119 keywords used . The bib is in the form of a PostScript file . The printout is 41 pages long . Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file . It's named " speer.raytrace.bib.ps . Z " and is compressed at most sites - Site Dir wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics / graphics / bib / RT.BIB.Speer/ karazm.math.uh.edu pub / Graphics / gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub / papers / nic.funet.fi pub / sci / papers / graphics coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics / papers / Eric Haines ( erich@eye.com ) maintains ray tracing and radiosity / global illumination bibliographies . These are in " refer " format , and so can be searched electronically ( a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each ) . The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above , and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu : pub / Graphics / Papers as " RayBib . * " and " RadBib . * " . Tom Wilson ( wilson@cs.ucf.edu ) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books . The information is essentially in plaintext , and Latex and troff formatting programs are included . This collection is available at most of the sites above as " rtabs . * " . 17 ) SIGGRAPH information online [ from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick ] ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at siggraph.org ( 128.248 . 245.250 ) . This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server . The anonymous ftp service is very standard , and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories . To retrieve information by electronic mail , send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish . A good place to start is with the command send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information . 18 ) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available [ from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd ] ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH ' 91 Panels Proceedings at the siggraph.org site ( 128.248 . 245.250 ) . The proceedings are available in three formats : text ( ASCII ) rtf ( rich text format , suitable for many word processors ) word ( MS Word for the Macintosh ) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways : ( 1 ) by anonymous ftp change to one of the directories publications / s91 / panels_proceedings / [ text | rtf | word ] The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode , while the word files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary mode . Each directory contains a Table of Contents file ( TOC ) that describes the contents of each panel file . ( 2 ) by electronic mail send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org You can retrieve either the text or rtf files . We suggest that you first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages send panel 91 - txt index send panel 91 - rtf index in the subject or body of the message . You will get the necessary information to retrieve the actual transcript files . 19 ) Graphics mailing lists There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there , each covering either a single product or a single topic . I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now , and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing . Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added .

Comments - 26 formats , no software ( this is good , IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent ) . Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us . 21 ) What about GIF ? GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format . It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms . It is quite limited in some ways ( yes , the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all ) , and in fact , I don't like it much . However , it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list . The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF . Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups : alt.binaries.pictures . d , alt.binaries.pictures.misc , alt.binaries.pictures.utilities , alt.binaries.pictures.fractals , alt.binaries.pictures.fine - art . d , news.answers Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup ( s ) , or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files : / pub / usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 / pub / usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of : send usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Send a message containing " help " to get general information about the mail server . Also , you could check out the resources described in sections 7 , 8 , and 20 above for more information . 22 ) What is morphing ? Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location . Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one . Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing . This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub / graphics / bibliography / Morph . There are three files : morph_intro . ps . Z ( PostScript version , many pictures - 1.5 M ) morph_intro . txt . Z ( text version ) m_responses . Z ( Responses to morphing questions ) The files are compressed , so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards . 23 ) How to ray-trace height fields Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing . They have a number of uses , such as terrain rendering , and some optimization is possible . Thus , they get their own FAQ section . Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above . The following paper seems to be the definitive reference : F . Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing : Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July , 1988 <musg88.ps.Z> This is available as " Research Report YALEU / DCS / RR - 639 " from Yale University , it's also in the SIGGRAPH ' 91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes , and ( best of all ) it's available on the net : nic.funet.fi pub / sci / papers / musg88.ps .

Pn , not in the x-y plane , is given by Area ( Polygon ) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk + 1 } | where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex . The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator . Sigma represents the summation operator . | | represents the absolute value operator . Pn + 1 is equal to P0 . 25 ) How to join ACM / SIGGRAPH Probably the easiest way to join ACM / SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM . Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank . Fill it out and mail it in . ACM membership for students costs $ 23.00 , Voting or Associate Membership $ 77.00 ( yearly ) SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $ 16.00 , $ 26.00 for Voting or Associate Members ( also yearly ) . To get TOG ( Transactions on Graphics ) it's another $ 26.00 for students and $ 31.00 for Voting or Associate Members .

The LightWave software ( LightWave = LightWave 3D and LightWave Modeler ) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes . - - WHY ARE WE DOING THIS ? - - This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software , how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them . The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package . We hope to share information , tips , procedures and to bond as a group . - - WHAT ARE THE RULES ? - - Since LightWave / Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software , I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster . However , we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software , related tools and products . You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list ! - - OK ! HOW DO I JOIN ? - - To become a member of the LightWave 3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address : lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter : subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list . At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon . There shouldn't be too much of a delay in joining . Expect a " welcome " message within 5 days after you send your request . Then , expect the mail to start flowing in ! - - HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST ? - - Contributing to the list is simple . Just mail your articles to the following address : lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list . Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list . However , those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you . So , if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid , your original article will be returned to you . This doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list . In fact , just the opposite is true . It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address . NOTE : I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon . - - HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST ? - - Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up : lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter : unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain I will remove your name from the list of members . PLEASE , if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while , send a request to be removed from the list ! If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you . - - WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES ? - - I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site ( bobsbox ) . However , I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space . What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list . They can compress and store them in archives on their system . They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates . If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes . <grin> I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles , the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave 3D mailing list . For information on this service , please send a mail message to : fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com The first command to the server must be " HELP " or " USER name <passwd> " . Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile . Use USER name [ passwd ] to connect to the service . Use ? to get a short listing of all available commands . - - NOW WHAT DO I DO ? - - Well , sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information . If you have something to offer , please feel free to contribute that information to the list . Every little bit helps . Questions are welcomed ! It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them . <grin> If you have any questions or comments regarding the list , please contact me at the address : lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com Cheers , Bob LindaburyFrom : tom@inferno.UUCP ( Tom Sherwin ) Subject : Re : XV under MS-DOS ? ! ? | > Hi ...

I would appreciate any comments . Yes , I do . A couple of years ago , I did a comparison of the two products . Some of this may have changed , but here goes . As far as a PHIGS + implementation , Figaro + is fine . But , its PHIGS ! Personally , I hate PHIGS because I find it is too low level . I also dislike structure editing , which I find impossible , but enough about PHIGS . I have found HOOPS to be a system that is full-featured and easy to use . They support all of their rendering methods in software when there is no hardware support , their documentation is good , and they are easily portable to other systems .

A 3DO marketing rep . recently offered a Phillips marketing rep . a $ 100 bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule . The Phillips rep . declined the bet , probably because he knew that 3DO players are already in pre-production manufacturing runs , 6 months before the commercial release date . By the time of commercial release , there will be other manufacturers of 3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production . Chip sets will be in full production . The number of software companies designing titles for the box will be over 300 . How do I know this ? I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters last week .

New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology . The tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software . There are three levels of DSP programming associated with the NB-DSP 2300 board and LabVIEW : Use of the NB-DSP 2300 Analysis Library : FFTs , power spectra , filters routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop ( MPW ) C that execute on the NB-DSP 2300 board . There is an analysis Virtual Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP 2300 . Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an optimizing C compiler , an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the DSP hardware . This approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use . Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the NB-DSP 2300 board . ( This is the easiest route for the development of custom code . ) Ultimage Concept VI - - - Concept VI by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual Instruments ( VIs ) that give LabVIEW 2 ( described above ) users high-end tools for designing , integrating and monitoring imaging control systems . A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument . Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography , surveillance , machine vision , production testing , biomedical imaging , electronic microscopy and remote sensing . Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis . It includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement , histogram equalization , spatial and frequency filtering , isolation of features , thresholding , mathematical morphology analysis , density measurement , object counting , sizing and characterization . The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 , a pixel depth of 8 , 16 , or 32 bits , and one image plane . Standard input and output formats include PICT , TIFF , SATIE , and AIPD . Other formats can be imported . Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations , spatial linear and non-linear filters , frequency filtering , arithmetic and logic operations , and geometric transformations , among others . Morphological transformations include erosion , dilation , opening , closing , hole removal , object separation , and extraction of skeletons , among others . Quantitative analysis provides for objects ' detection , measurement , and morphological distribution . Measures include area , perimeter , center of gravity , moment of inertia , orientation , length of relevant chords , and shape factors and equivalence . Measures are saved in ASCII format . The program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules . A 3 - D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot . The histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale . The twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for : masking and averaging sections of images , noise removal , making comparisons , etc . There are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity . These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines . The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as either the ( real , imaginary ) components or the ( phase , magnitude ) data . The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts . The transformations include : thresholding , eroding , dilating and even hole filling . The program's quantitative analysis measurements include : area , perimeter , center of mass , object counts , and angle between points .

It is called HIPS , and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images . It has been growing since we first wrote it , both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library . Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research , system development and teaching . It handles sequences of images ( movies ) in precisely the same manner as single frames . Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations , filtering , convolution , Fourier and other transform processing , edge detection and line drawing manipulation , digital image compression and transmission methods , noise generation , and image statistics computation . Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed . As a result , almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently . Additionally , HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines . New users become effective using HIPS on their first day . HIPS features images that are self-documenting . Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image . HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header , and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX ` ` filters ' ' . It comes complete with source code , on-line manual pages , and on-line documentation . Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University , HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available . It runs under the UNIX operating system . It is modular and flexible , provides automatic documentation of its actions , and is almost entirely independent of special equipment . HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax , Sun , Apollo , Masscomp , NCR Tower , Iris , IBM AT , etc . For image display and input , drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage ( Ikonas ) image processors , and the Sun - 2 , Sun - 3 , Sun - 4 , and Sun - 386i consoles . We also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages ( Sun gfx , Sun console , Matrox VIP - 1024 , ITI IP - 512 , Lexidata , Macintosh II , X windowing system , and Iris ) . The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS - 4000 . It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame - stores , and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max - Video . HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98 % of HIPS is machine independent . Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system , both as an interactive research tool , and for more production - oriented tasks . It is both easy to use , and quickly adapted and extended to new uses . HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format ( either reel - to-reel or Sun cartridge ) , and comes with source code , libraries , a library of convolu - tion masks , and on-line documentation and manual pages .

What i want to do is the following ; From a fast source , eg . a CDROM , several sound sources are read , each having it's own defined position and other attributes , eg . direction etc . Given the listeners position and direction , the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction . This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source . ( I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear , and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle . This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source . This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation . ) Additionally some reflection , diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated , but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation , kinda like some radiosity algorithm .

I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working code , which I will also include . The intersection of 3 planes method looks best , but my implementation based on a short article in Graphics Gems I doesn't work . I may be misinterpreting , of course . I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor of dot and cross products , but the former may actually be better . In either case a matrix determinant needs to be computed ( implicitly in the solution of linear equations ) . To get the planes , I was taking the midpoint of the line from , say , P1 to P2 , and setting the normal as the " normalized " vector from P1 to P2 . These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems . HOwever , the resulting center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points ( for different tests ) . My matrix / vector math is very rusty , but it looks like I need to verify the formula , or use the simultaneous equation solution , which will require bringing in another routine I don't have ( but should be easy to find ) . Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets of 3 points , and intersecting the normals from there . This would also define the circle center . However , small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect . Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel .

They are fairly simple , but I've found them to be very fast ( for my purposes , anyway ) . Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h , define a " virtual screen " , put and get pixels , put a pixmap ( rectangular image with no transparent spots ) , put a sprite ( image with see-thru areas ) , copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory , etc .

Schmidt ) Subject : outlining of spline surface About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult . I am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and ( hopefully ) some published solutions to it . The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines . For inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional , i . e . only extant between the edges , but which exists in three dimensional space . To draw the object we 1 ) fit a cubic spline through the points . Each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve . Each spline has an equal number of segments . We assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly , but not exactly , the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure . 2 ) Take each segment ( n ) along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline . Use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface . 3 ) Depth sort the triangles 4 ) Take each triangle in sorted order , project onto a 2D pixmap , draw and color the triangle . Take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special " edge color " It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the problem . The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface . The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface . The reasons for this are fairly complicated . They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines . If anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area . - ThanksFrom : rgc3679@bcstec.ca.boeing.com ( Robert G .

Does anyone have any such code or a reference to book containing | > information on the subject ? | > | > Regards | > | > Simon Basically , there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside , outside or on the polygon . The first one is Ray ( or half line ) method . In this method , you can draw any ray , if the number of the intersection point of the ray and the polygon is even , then it is outside . If the number is odd , then it is inside . Of cause , you have to deal with the special cases which may make you headache . The second method is PI algorithm . Draw the lines between the point and all the vertices on the polygon . Calculate and sum the angles of the successive lines . If the result is 2 * PI , then it is inside . If PI , then it is on the polygon . Otherwise it is outside . My experience tells the second method is relible . Hope this helps .

While I was working with it this morning , the screen started to flicker a little , which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and all peripherals . It only did this for a second and then stopped . I left the room for several minutes and , when I returned , the screen was completely dim , not blank , but very very dim . The contrast slider still worked so that I could adjust it to where I could * faintly * make out what was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely * no * effect . I was plugged-in at the time ( i . e . , not using the battery ) but I still tried switching the battery , changing the power-saver features , etc . , etc . , all to no avail . Has anyone else experienced anything like this ? If this just means that I need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the " death " of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually happened . I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the net about this because I already know what they'll say : " Yep , you gotta have this replaced and it's gonna cost you $ ? ? ? . " I've only had the computer for about 21 months . Is that a reasonable life cycle for a LCD display ? Oh , I guess I ought to give specifics here : the brand is Compudyne ( Is this a reputable company ? ) , it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz . I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down before coming in to work today . If anyone can help me , PLEASE give me any advice you might have .

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing 3 - D interactive applications what types of 3 - D widgets you would like to have in your applications . A 3 - D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3 - D objects of the application . It may let you - manipulate application data , the camera , 3 - D objects in the scene and so on , or - view the status of the application or 3 - D objects via the widget's shape , color , position , orientation and so on , or - do whatever I missed but you think is possible . For example , a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball ( shown as a partially transparent sphere ) super-imposed on the object to be rotated . A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects . The length of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the ruler indicating the distance . A widget can provide both manipulation and feedback . For example , the ruler can be used to change the distance between the objects along its own axis . Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3 - D interaction . The information I gathered will help me design a 3 - D UI construction tool . Your help is very much appreciated .

Speaking of SIGGRAPH , I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night , and was I ever grossed out ! The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery ! For example : SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $ 26 last year to $ 59 this year for the same thing , a 127 % increase . Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the annual conference could reduce this to $ 27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite , which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $ 32 ( or so ) for the proceedings and the art show catalog , essentially . TOPLAS went up 40 % in cost , way outstripping the current inflation rate . Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same , but whereas before SIGCHI membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings , these are now an extra cost option . Bundling that back into the basic rate , equivalent services have gone up 100 % in cost . SIGOIS membership cost has up 33 % , but they've also split out the Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to be included with membership . Adding that cost back in means this SIG also has doubled its membership fee . What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago touting their new approach to providing member services , and tried to make it sound like they were offering NEW services . But with the exception of a couple , like SIGGRAPH , all the " plus " services appear to be just splitting the costs into smaller piles so that they don't look so big . But their recommended changes to my membership would have me paying 90 % more than last year for a 31 % increase in services ( measured by cost , not by value ) , and , curiously , a 31 % inflation rate on the publications I got last year .

Possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your calculator . 256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is 307,200 which is 300k to be exact . 640x400x256 only takes 250k but I don't think it is a BIOS mode . I wouldn't bet that all VGA cards can do that either . If a VGA card has 512k I bet it can do both 640x400 and 640x480 .

Well , GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by Compuserve back in 1987 ( ? ) or so . It was to create a format that could be read and displayed by any system . GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has a built in compression scheme ( LZW ? ) . IFF is not really a graphics format , but rather a standard way to package images , sounds , animations , text , or whatever into one file . IFF was created by Electronic Arts , I do believe ( I could be wrong ) , for the Amiga . It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga . The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM ( InterLeaved BitMap ? ) but many others exist . This format supports 24 bit color images .

It does a much better job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration programs . Of course , a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more accurate trace . The problem that I've run into though , is that when it creates a detailed trace , it produces WAY more points than are necessary . If I trace something manually , I use many less es points . The problem with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down , especially printing .

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics . I'm not sure if reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not . I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that handles graphics requests , queued on a mailbox , one at a time . If this provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need for a reentrant graphics library .

Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association " Spectrum " offer VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC / AT , wich include software and set of controllers . SOFTWARE For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed . Kit includes more then 200 different functions for image processing . Kit works in the interactive regime , and has include Help for non professional users . There are next possibility : - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family ; - read - white image to - from disk ; - print image on the printer ; - makes arithmetic with 2 frames ; - filter image ; - work with gistogramme ; - edit image . - include users exe modules . CONTROLLER VS9 The function of VS - 9 controller is to load TV-images into PC / AT . VS - 9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from a field of 724x600 pixels . The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image . This provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal and vertical directions . The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256 . Video signal capture time - 2.5 s . CONTROLLER VS52 The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM PC AT or any other machine of that type . The controller was created on the base of modern elements , including user programmable gate arrays . The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different resolutions . Its flexible architecture makes possible to change technical parameters . Instead of TV signal one can process any other analog signal ( including signals from slow-speed scanning devices ) . The controller has the following technical characteristics : - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ; - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64 to 1024x512 pixels ; - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024 pixels ; - video signal capture time - 40 ms . - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024 pixels ; - number of gray level - 256 ; - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input / output lookup table ( LUT ); - possibility to realize " scroll " and " zoom " ; - 8 lines for external synchronization ( an input using external controlling signal ) ; - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog - digital converter ; - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor . One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the controller by reprogramming it . IMAGE PROCESSOR VS100 Image processor VS100 allows to digitize and process TV signal in real time . It is possible digitize TV signal with 512 * 512 * 8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation with two images . Processor was created on the base of modern elements including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board for PC . Memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512 * 512 * 8 format . It is possible to accumulate until 16 images . The processor has the following technical characteristics : - memory volume to 64 Mb ; - number of the gray level - 256 ; - 4 input video multiplexer ; - input / output lookup table ; - electronic adjustment for black and white ADC reference ; - image size from 256 * 256 to 8192 * 8192 ; - possibility color and black / white output ; - possibility input from slow-scan video sources .From : mabusj@nason110.its.rpi.edu ( Jasen M .

I think one ( not ideal ) solution is to use the tracing utility ( can't remember the name , sorry ! ) included in the Corel Draw s / w pack . It can convert bitmaps to Corel art format . These can then be imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap . Result - the file is completely in Corel format and can be SCODAL'ed no problem !

From 3DO , RJ Mical ( of Amiga / Lynx fame ) and Hal Josephson ( sp ? ) were there to talk about the machine and their plan . We got to see the unit displaying full-screen movies using the CompactVideo codec ( which was nice , very little blockiness showing clips from Jaws and Backdraft ) ... and a very high frame rate to boot ( like 30fps ) . Note however that the 3DO ' s screen resolution is 320x240 . CompactVideo is pretty amazing ...

I'm sure if the material had been compressed at the large size then it would play back fine ( I have a Q950 and do this quite a bit ) . The price of generality ... personally I don't use the dynamic sizing of movies often , if ever . But playing back stuff at its original size is plenty quick on the latest 040 machines .

Originally I was inspired by the NAPLPS graphics standard ( a summary of which hit this group about 2 weeks ago ) . Following up on software availability of NAPLPS supporting software I find that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being PP3 which runs soley on MSDOS machines leaving Mac and Amiga users to buy full commercial software if they want to try out the BBS ( I know I wouldn't ) Next most interesting possibility is to port MGR to PC , Mac , Amiga . I know there is an old version of a Mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under System 7 But I can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if I can patch it . Is there a color version of MGR for Linux ? I know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but I misplaced it . Does anyone on this group know if MGR as been ported to PC or Amiga ?

Of course the chances of Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics that you are looking for . I think you may have left out a few important parameters . The polygons are all convex . They have less than N sides . ( you are drawing meshes walls doors etc . ) I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave / self intersecting polygons . This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line . Complex ( figure 8 type polygons ) can be a bit trickier . The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made . Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex polygons . > finding something like that are pretty remote , so I guess I'd need the source > with it .

I've tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the chord between the two adjacent view points ( which in general are not key frames ) , but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the viewing direction vector at the key frame positions ( although the spatial movement seems to work fine ; and I'm quite certain - I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation error ... ) Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors .

Hi everyone , I thought that some people may be interested in my VR software on these groups : * * * Announcing the release of Multiverse -1.0 . 2 * * * Multiverse is a multi-user , non-immersive , X-Windows based Virtual Reality system , primarily focused on entertainment / research . Features : Client-Server based model , using Berkeley Sockets . No limit to the number of users ( apart from performance ) . Generic clients . Customizable servers . Hierachical Objects ( allowing attachment of cameras and light sources ) . Multiple light sources ( ambient , point and spot ) . Objects can have extension code , to handle unique functionality , easily attached . Functionality : Client : The client is built around a ' fast ' render loop . Basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's viewpoint . It also provides the server with information about the user's actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users . The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world . This means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it . The adaptations , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the servers . This release of the client software supports the following functionality : o Hierarchical Objects ( with associated addressing ) o Multiple Light Sources and Types ( Ambient , Point and Spot ) o User Interface Panels o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading ( optional wireframe for faster frame rates ) o Mouse and Keyboard Input ( Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't , but because I don't have one ! This will , however , be one of the first enhancements ! ) Server ( s ): This is where customization can take place . The following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers : o Transparent Client Management o Client Message Handling This may not sound like much , but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally . Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality . This is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects : o Server Selectable Extension Installation : What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world . Basically you call the extension initialisers you want . o Event Handler Registration : When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to . ( Current events supported : INIT , MOVE , CHANGE , COLLIDE & TERMINATE ) o Collision Detection Registration : If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software . Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs . This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose . The following is all you need to make a World Server application : o Provide an initWorld function : This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported , plus any initialization you want to do . o Provide a positionObject function : This is where you determine where to place a new client . o Provide an installWorldObjects function : This is where you load the world ( . wld ) file for a new client . o Provide a getWorldType function : This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have . o Provide an animateWorld function : This is where you can go wild ! At a minimum you should let the objects move ( by calling a move function ) and let the server sleep for a bit ( to avoid outrunning the clients ) . That's all there is to it ! And to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers I've provided : generic - 81 lines dactyl - 270 lines ( more complicated collision detection due to the stairs ! Will probably be improved with future versions ) dogfight - 72 lines Location : This software is located at the following site : ftp.u.washington.edu Directory : pub / virtual-worlds File : multiverse-1.0.2.tar . Z Futures : Client : o Texture mapping . o More realistic rendering : i . e . Z-Buffering ( or similar ) , Gouraud shading o HMD support . o Etc , etc ... Server : o Physical Modelling ( gravity , friction etc ) . o Enhanced Object Management / Interaction o Etc , etc ... Both : o Improved Comms ! ! ! I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse software , unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation , and I'm not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified ! :-( I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it , and I would * LOVE * to add support for the PowerGlove ... and an HMD :-) ! ! Finally one major disclaimer : This is totally amateur code . By that I mean there is no support for this code other than what I , out the kindness of my heart , or you , out of pure desperation , provide . I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK ! Disclaimer over ! Of course if you love it , I would like to here from you . And anyone with POSITIVE contributions / criticisms is also encouraged to contact me . Anyone who hates it : > / dev / null ! * * * * * * And if anyone wants to let me do this for a living : you know where to write :-) ! * * * * * * Thanks , Robert . robert@acsc.com ^ ^ ^From : berger@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu ( David Berger ) Subject : Need some Graphics Help !

Here is a short description and some technical information , taken from the accompanying documentation : DMPEG V1 . 0 Public Domain MPEG decoder by Stefan Eckart 0 . Features = = = DMPEG / DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder / player for the PC : - decodes ( nearly ) the full MPEG video standard ( I , P , B frames , frame size up to at least 352x240 supported ) - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display - optional on-screen display during decoding ( requires VGA ) - several dithering options : ordered dither , Floyd-Steinberg , grayscale - color-space selection - runs under DOS , 640KB RAM , no MS-Windows required - very compact ( small code / small data models , 16 bit arithmetic ) - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for VGA and many Super-VGAs ... 4 . Technical information = = = The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [ 1 ] . The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [ 2 ] ( not quite the optimum , I know ) . Blocks with not more than eight non-zero coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D - IDCT ( sounds great , doesn't it ? ) , which turned out to be faster than a ' fast ' algorithm in this ( quite common ) case . Dithering is pretty standard . Main difference to the Berkeley decoder ( except for the fewer number of supported algorithms ) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors , the ( default ) option to use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation dominant ordered dither . This leads to a significantly superior quality of the dithered image ( I claim , judge yourself ) . Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to + / -0.25 ( instead of + / -0.5 ) and the display color-space points are distributed over this restricted space . Since the distance between color-space points is thus reduced by a factor of two , the color resolution is doubled at the expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors . Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color , lying somewhere between the points of the display color space , is approximated by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of constant saturation . This yields subjectivly better quality due to the lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than to hue changes ( the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve on NTSC ) . The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish areas .

Hi , I've noticed that if you only save a model ( with all your mapping planes positioned carefully ) to a . 3DS file that when you reload it after restarting 3DS , they are given a default position and orientation . But if you save to a . PRJ file their positions / orientation are preserved . Does anyone know why this information is not stored in the . 3DS file ? Nothing is explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the . PRJ file . I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information , does anyone have the format for the . PRJ file ?

Lindley published by Wiley It addresses reading / writing to / from PCX / TIFF files ; image acquisition , manipulation and storage ; and has source code in the book . The source is primarily written in Turbo C and naturally has conversion possibilities . I have converted some of it to Quick C . Naturally , the code has some problems in the book - as usuall . Typos , syntax , etc . are problems . It can be a good learning experience for someone who is studying C . There is also a companion disk with source available for order and $ 50.00 .

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion . Below is a very short description of the process which we use ; if you have further questions , feel free to poke me via e-mail . = = = * ASSUME : locally smooth distortion 0 ) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your ( x , y ) points . This defines the set of neighbors for each point . If your data are not naturally convex , you may have very long edges on the convex hull . Consider deleting these edges . 1 ) Now , there are two goals : a ) move the DistortedData ( x , y ) to the Reference ( x , y ) b ) keep the Length ( e ) ( as measured from the current ( x , y ) ' s ) as close as possible to the DigitizedLength ( e ) ( as measured using the digitized ( x , y ) ' s ) . 2 ) For every point , compute a displacement based on a ) and b ) . For example : a ) For ( x , y ) points for which you know the Reference ( x , y ) , you can move alpha 0 * ( Reference ( x , y ) - Current ( x , y ) ) . This will slowly move the DistortedReference ( x , y ) towards the Reference ( x , y ) . b ) For all other points , examine the current length of each edge . For each edge , compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length ( where " correct " is the DigitizedLength ) . Take the vector sum of these edge displacements , and move the point alpha 1 * SumOfEdgeDisplacements . This will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh . 3 ) Iterate 2 ) until you are happy ( for example , no point moves very much ) . alpha 0 and alpha 1 need to be determined by experimentation . Consider how much you believe the Reference ( x , y ) - i . e . , do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the References , or do you want to balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length of the edges . WARNING : there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed ( essentially , you can't allow the convex hull to change , and you can't allow triangles to " fold over " neighboring triangles . Both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points , or by periodically re-triangulating the points ( using the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the original positions . When we first did this , the triangulation time was prohibitive , so we only did it once . If I were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years , I * might * go back and re-triangulate on every iteration . If you have more compute power than you know what to do with , you might consider having every point interact with every other point ... but first read up on linear solutions to the n-body problem . There are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on springs , constraints , and energy calculations which are relevant . The above method is described , in more or less detail in : @inproceedings { Sloan 86 , author = " Sloan , Jr . , Kenneth R . and David Meyers and Christine A . ~ Curcio " , title = " Reconstruction and Display of the Retina " , booktitle = " Proceedings : Graphics Interface ' 86 Vision Interface ' 86 " , address = " Vancouver , Canada " , pages = " 385 - - 389 " , month = " May " , year = 1986 } @techreport { Curcio 87b , author = " Christine A . ~ Curcio and Kenneth R . ~ Sloan and David Meyers " , title = " Computer Methods for Sampling , Reconstruction , Display , and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts " , number = " TR 87-12- 03 " , institution = " Department of Computer Science , University of Washington " , address = " Seattle , WA " , month = " December " , year = 1987 } @article { Curcio 89 , author = " Christine A . ~ Curcio and Kenneth R . ~ Sloan and David Meyers " , title = " Computer Methods for Sampling , Reconstruction , Display , and Analysis of Retinal Whole Mounts " , journal = " Vision Research " , volume = 29 , number = 5 , pages = " 529 - - 540 " , year = 1989 } - - Kenneth Sloan Computer and Information Sciences sloan@cis.uab.edu University of Alabama at Birmingham (205) 934-2213 115A Campbell Hall , UAB Station (205) 934-5473 FAX Birmingham , AL 35294-1170From : pinky@tamu.edu ( The Man behind The Curtain ) Subject : Views on isomorphic perspectives ? I'm working upon a game using an isometric perspective , similar to that used in Populous . Basically , you look into a room that looks similar to the following : xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx 2 xxxx 1 xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx 3 / | \ xxxx xxxx / ~ \ xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision . [ * ] Since your viewpoint is always the same , the routines can be hard-coded for a particular vantage . In my case , wall two's rising edge has a slope of 1/4 . ( I'm also using Mode X , 320x240 ) . I've run into two problems ; I'm sure that other readers have tried this before , and have perhaps formulated their own opinions : 1 ) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial , but when I ran a packed -> planar image through them , I was dismayed by the " jaggies . " I'm now considered some anti-aliasing routines ( speed is not really necessary ) . Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed , thus being assured of nice image , or is this too much of a burden ? 2 ) Wall 3 presents a problem ; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort the original . I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where , and failed . Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape ? Currently I take : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 and produce : 1 2 3 4 33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20 5 6 7 8 49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24 9 10 11 12 53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16 57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32 61 62 63 64 Line 1 follows the slope . Line 2 is directly under line 1 . Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels . Line 4 is under line 3 . This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels . But it causes distortions . Has anyone come up with a better way ? Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed ? Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective ? I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering . Locations are stored in ( x , y , z ) form . [ * ] For those of you who noticed , the top lines of wall 2 ( and wall 1 ) * are * parallel with its bottom lines . This is why there appears to be an optical illusion ( ie . it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube , depending on your mood ) . There are no vanishing points . This simplifies the drawing code for objects ( which don't have to change size as they move about in the room ) . I've decided that this approximation is alright , since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing . Hopefully the " context " of the picture ( ie . chairs on the floor , torches hanging on the walls ) will dispell any visual ambiguity .

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics accelerators . It's quite fast ( I have 7 ) , but as usual with new boards / chips the drivers are buggy for Windows . As far as Winmarks go , it depends upon the version . I think I got 42M winmarks with version 3.11 . 2.5 yielded the 50 + number .

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it does playing back resized movies . Apparently the process of expanding each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate bit depth is pretty processor-intensive . There are optimizers that work pretty well for showing movies at double size , but if you drop to 1.9 x size or increase to 2.1 x size , performance suffers dramatically . > Then I asked him what Mac he was using ... He was using a Quadra ( don't know > what model , 900 ? ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime > could play back at the same speed even on an LCII . He lied . :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent . He was probably confused by the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode , and will play in the same amount of time on any machine . However , an LC will drop frames in order to keep the sound and video synced up . The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar performance , though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture . > Well , I spoiled his claim so to say , since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having > a little bit of trouble .

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 - - I was using was 1.5 . One of the new codecs in v1 . 5 allows video at nearly twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle . The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla , with the exception of the nice speakers that were playing the sound , and the software was Movie Player , the QT player Apple includes with the software . > Don't misunderstand me , I just want to clarify this .

ThanksFrom : ldo@waikato.ac.nz ( Lawrence D'Oliveiro , Waikato University ) Subject : QuickTime performance ( was Re : Rumours about 3DO ? ? ? ) OK , with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime , the effects of scaling and so on , I thought I'd do some more tests . First of all , I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic . The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it ( it was a version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor ) . I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results ( for better or for worse ) . I pulled out a copy of " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " that I had recorded off TV a while back . About fifteen minutes into the movie , there's a sequence where the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station . Specifically , I digitized a portion of about 30 seconds ' duration , zooming in on the rotating space station . I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames . To increase the differences between frames , I digitized it at only 5 frames per second , to give a total of 171 frames . I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384 * 288 pixels with the Spigot card in my Centris 650 ( quarter-size resolution from a PAL source ) . I then imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor , keeping the 5 fps frame rate . I created two versions of the movie : one scaled to 320 * 240 resolution , the other at 160 * 120 resolution . I used the default " 2.00 " quality setting in Premiere 2.0 . 1 , and specified a key frame every ten frames . I then ran the 320 * 240 movie through the same " Raw Speed Test " program I used for the results I'd been reporting earlier . Result : a playback rate of over 45 frames per second . That's right , I was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie . Just for fun , I copied the 320 * 240 movie to my external hard disk ( a Quantum LP105S ) , and ran it from there . This time the playback rate was only about 35 frames per second . Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk ( also a Quantum ) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback . I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors , and tried playing back the 160 * 120 movie scaled to 320 * 240 size . This time the playback speed was over 60 fps . Clearly , the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in action , not 1.5 . I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0 , but I don't think it's entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1 ... Unscaled , the playback rate for the 160 * 120 movie was over 100 fps . The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320 * 240 movie with " preferred " playback rates greater than 1.0 , and seeing how well they played from within MoviePlayer ( ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback ) . A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps ) didn't work too well : the playback was very jerky . Compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with ease . I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this much overhead : I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task switching . A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps ) seemed to work fine : I couldn't see any evidence of stutter . At 8.0 (=> 40 fps ) I * think * I could see slight stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard to tell . I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames , to make the stutter more noticeable . Of course , this will also improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance even more ...

I'm thinking to treat the raw data .. not > compressed . Actually , for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than you need , unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed HDTV . Also , my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB , even using 24 bits / pixel ( which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or 18 should be enough for a moving picture ) . 1600x1100x16bits is 3.5 MB ( I'm guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600 , I'm fairly sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals ) . I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB / s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system .

No . That's * not * what I was complaining about , nor did I intend to suggest that DEC was any better than SGI ( let me tell you about the Lynx some day , but be prepared with a large sedative if you do ... ) . My comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors that supported OpenGL , rather than deal further with SGI . What I * am * annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we * would * be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck . I'm also annoyed about being sold * several * Personal IRISes at a previous site on the understanding * that * architecture would be around for a while , rather than being flushed . Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line ( odd that I found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter ) , but I'm just a little tired of getting boned in the process . Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies , so we aren't entitled to a " peek under the covers " as the Big Kids ( NASA , for instance ) are . This lab , and I suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations , doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers every year , so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis . The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond . That means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one previous poster's words , ' to fill a niche ' to compete with some other vendor . I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years .

The fastest ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy ( IBM also sells these ) . They can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB / sec . ( 64 bit ) . For these kinds of data rates you need more than SCSI for connections . Their latest model , the RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB / sec . but I think this may be a limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not exceeded that speed since their older model was faster . They are also not idle ( must be working on newer products that might be faster ) and are a small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces .

JPEG ( pronounced " jay-peg " ) is a standardized image compression mechanism . JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group , the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of " natural " , real-world scenes . It does not work so well on non-realistic images , such as cartoons or line drawings . JPEG does not handle black-and-white ( 1 - bit-per-pixel ) images , nor does it handle motion picture compression . Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees , named JBIG and MPEG respectively . JPEG is " lossy " , meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in . The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark . Thus , JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans . If you plan to machine-analyze your images , the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you , even if they are invisible to the eye . A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters . This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality . You can make * extremely * small files if you don't mind poor quality ; this is useful for indexing image archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc . etc . Conversely , if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression . [ 2 ] Why use JPEG ? There are two good reasons : to make your image files smaller , and to store 24 - bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8 - bit-per-pixel data . Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images . Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time ! ( If you are comparing GIF and JPEG , the size ratio is more like four to one . More details below . ) If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly , you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images . Even with a JPEG-capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format ( GIF , for instance ) . Thus , using JPEG is essentially a time / space tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply . It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file . I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself . The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information : 24 bits / pixel ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less ( 256 or fewer colors ) . If you have only 8 - bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you . Within a couple of years , though , 8 - bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today . Furthermore , for reasons detailed in section 7 , JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware . Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard . [ 3 ] When should I use JPEG , and when should I stick with GIF ? JPEG is * not * going to displace GIF entirely ; for some types of images , GIF is superior in image quality , file size , or both . One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to . As a rule of thumb , JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of " realistic " scenes ; that means scanned photographs and similar material . JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24 - bit display hardware , and it is a LOT superior if you do . ( See section 7 for details . ) GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors , such as cartoons and line drawings . In particular , large areas of pixels that are all * exactly * the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF . JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects . This sort of image is best kept in GIF form . ( In particular , single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files , but they should be avoided in JPEG files . ) JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges : a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels , for example . Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting . Again , this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly often in GIF files : borders , overlaid text , etc . The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high . If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text , don't JPEG it . Computer-drawn images ( ray-traced scenes , for instance ) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity . The more complex and subtly rendered the image , the more likely that JPEG will do well on it . The same goes for semi-realistic artwork ( fantasy drawings and such ) . Plain black-and-white ( two level ) images should never be converted to JPEG . You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images . It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels , while JPEG is not . If you have an existing library of GIF images , you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG . You will lose a little image quality if you do . ( Section 7 , which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF , only applies if both formats start from a full-color original . If you start from a GIF , you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information ; JPEG can only make things worse . ) However , the disk space savings may justify converting anyway . This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself . If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG , see section 14 for hints . Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format , since some GIFs will not convert well . [ 4 ] How well does JPEG compress images ? Pretty darn well . Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy , a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor . The first three files are for comparison purposes ; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B . File Size in bytes Comments ship.ppm 1145040 Original file in PPM format ( no compression ; 24 bits or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead ) ship.ppm . Z 963829 PPM file passed through Unix compress compress doesn't accomplish a lot , you'll note . Other text-oriented compressors give similar results . ship.gif 240438 Converted to GIF with ppmquant - fs 256 | ppmtogif Most of the savings is the result of losing color info : GIF saves 8 bits / pixel , not 24 . ( See sec . 7 . ) ship . jpg 95 155622 cjpeg - Q 95 ( highest useful quality setting ) This is indistinguishable from the 24 - bit original , at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs . ship . jpg 75 58009 cjpeg - Q 75 ( default setting ) You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original , even with both on-screen at once . ship . jpg 50 38406 cjpeg - Q 50 This has slight defects ; if you know what to look for , you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing the original . Still as good image quality as many recent postings in Usenet pictures groups . ship . jpg 25 25192 cjpeg - Q 25 JPEG's characteristic " blockiness " becomes apparent at this setting ( djpeg - blocksmooth helps some ) . Still , I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this . ship . jpg 5o 6587 cjpeg - Q 5 - optimize ( - optimize cuts table overhead ) Blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes . Note that this file is TINY : the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 ! In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality ( the - Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF , better if you have a full-color display ) . This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes . [ 5 ] What are good " quality " settings for JPEG ? Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs . image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting . There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings . " Quality 95 " does NOT mean " keep 95 % of the information " , as some have claimed . The quality scale is purely arbitrary ; it's not a percentage of anything . The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting ( smallest file size ) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original . This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb . The default quality setting ( - Q 75 ) is very often the best choice . This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image . Try - Q 75 first ; if you see defects , then go up . Except for experimental purposes , never go above - Q 95 ; saying - Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as - Q 95 , but of hardly any better quality . If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to go down to - Q 50 without objectionable degradation . On the other hand , you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation . The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG . The default - Q 75 is about right for compressing 24 - bit images , but - Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs ( see section 14 for more info ) . If you want a very small file ( say for preview or indexing purposes ) and are prepared to tolerate large defects , a - Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right . - Q 2 or so may be amusing as " op art " . ( Note : the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B , and to many programs based on it . Other JPEG implementations , such as Image Alchemy , may use a completely different quality scale . Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale , just " high " / " medium " / " low " - style choices . ) [ 6 ] Where can I get JPEG software ? Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP . If you don't know how to use FTP , see the FAQ article " How to find sources " . ( If you don't have direct access to FTP , read about ftpmail servers in the same article . ) That article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with " send usenet / news.answers/finding-sources " in the body . The " Anonymous FTP List FAQ " may also be helpful - - - it's usenet / news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive . NOTE : this list changes constantly . If you have a copy more than a couple months old , get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive . [ 6A ] If you are looking for " canned " software , viewers , etc : The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system . If you don't see what you want for your machine , check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list . Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet ; but some commercial programs are listed too . X Windows : XV ( shareware , $ 25 ) is an excellent viewer for JPEG , GIF , and many other image formats . It can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations . It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu ( 18.24 . 0.12 ) , file contrib / xv-3.00.tar . Z . Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support for 24 - bit displays and many other improvements ; however , it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking . If you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export . Note that version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24 - bit display ( you'll get only 8 - bit color ) , nor for converting 24 - bit images to JPEG . But 2.21 works fine for converting GIF and other 8 - bit images to JPEG . CAUTION : there is a glitch in version 2.21 : be sure to check the " save at normal size " checkbox when saving a JPEG file , or the file will be blurry . Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package , also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib / ImageMagick.tar . Z . This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks . The ImageMagick viewer handles 24 - bit displays correctly ; for colormapped displays , it does better ( though slower ) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software . Both of the above are large , complex packages . If you just want a simple image viewer , try xloadimage or xli . xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release , 3.03 . xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib / xloadimage-3.03.tar . Z . xli is a variant version of xloadimage , said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original . ( The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage , at least with respect to JPEG files , because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1 . The next xloadimage release will fix this . ) xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib / xli.1.14.tar . Z . Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24 - bit displays . MS-DOS : This covers plain DOS ; for Windows or OS / 2 programs , see the next headings . One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG , which views JPEG and GIF files . The current version , 2.5 , is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca ( 129.97 . 50.50 ) , file pub / jpeg / viewers / dvpeg25.zip . This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines . The user interface is not flashy , but it's functional . Another freeware JPEG / GIF / TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview . The current version , 1.2 , is available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / hv12.zip . Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager ( QEMM 386 and 386MAX work ; Windows and OS / 2 do not ) . Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen . For larger images , it scales the image down to fit on the screen ( rather than using panning / scrolling as most viewers do ) . You may or may not prefer this approach , but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably . Note : installation is a bit tricky ; read the directions carefully ! A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ( $ 30 ) . This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives . Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking , although personally I find it harder to use - - - more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior . It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview , at least on my hardware . ( For images larger than screen size , DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed , and both are faster than Hiview . ) The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / dcview21.zip . Requires a VESA graphics driver ; if you don't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory . ( Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver , so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing . ) A second shareware alternative is Fullview , which has been kicking around the net for a while , but I don't know any stable archive location for it . The current ( rather old ) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway . The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel 20 archives at that time . The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow ( CSHOW ) supports JPEG in its latest revision , 8.60 a . However , CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good : it's slow ( about half the speed of the above viewers ) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays . Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW . Shareware , $ 25 . Available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / gif / cshw860a.zip . Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware , any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine . If you can't get * any * of them to work , you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF , then view with your favorite GIF viewer . ( If you have hi-color hardware , don't use GIF as the intermediate format ; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead . VPIC 5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays . ) The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / jpeg4.zip ( or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory ) . These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B ; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF , Targa , and PPM formats . Handmade Software offers free JPEG <=> GIF conversion tools , GIF 2JPG / JPG 2GIF . These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format ; in particular , you can't get 24 - bit color output from a JPEG . The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes , this is a useful capability . Version 2.0 of these tools is free ( prior versions were shareware ) . Get it from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / gif2jpg2.zip . NOTE : do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet , since it is not readable on non-PC platforms . Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package , Image Alchemy . This will translate JPEG files ( both JFIF and HSI formats ) to and from many other image formats . It can also display images . A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6 . 2 is available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE below ) , file msdos / graphics / alch162.zip . NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL 20 : The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel 20 , full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil ( 192.88 . 110.20 ) . Simtel 20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names ; where this document refers to directory ( eg ) " msdos / graphics " at Simtel 20 , that really means " pd1 : <msdos.graphics> " . If you are not physically on MILnet , you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel 20 . There are several Internet sites that maintain copies ( mirrors ) of the Simtel 20 archives ; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead . A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu ( 141.210 . 10.117 ) , which keeps Simtel 20 files in ( eg ) " / pub / msdos / graphics " . If you have no FTP capability , you can retrieve files from Simtel 20 by e-mail ; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how . If you are outside the USA , consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel 20 mirror is . Microsoft Windows : There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images . ( Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware , due to Windows ' system overhead . Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window . ) The newest entry is WinECJ , which is free and EXTREMELY fast . Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net , file / pub / bryanw / pc / jpeg / wecj.zip . Requires Windows 3.1 and 256 - or-more-colors mode . This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes ; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers . But it's so fast you'll use it anyway , at least for previewing ... JView is freeware , fairly fast , has good on-line help , and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format ; but it can't create new JPEG files , and it doesn't view GIFs . JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers ( such as brightness adjustment ) , but it's an excellent basic viewer . The current version , 0.9 , is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( 129.79 . 20.84 ) , file pub / pc / win 3 / desktop / jview090.zip . ( Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites , including wuarchive.wustl.edu . ) WinJPEG ( shareware , $ 20 ) displays JPEG , GIF , Targa , TIFF , and BMP image files ; it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter . It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow . The current version is 2.1 , available from Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos / windows 3 / winjp210.zip . ( This is a slow 286 - compatible version ; if you register , you'll get the 386 - only version , which is roughly 25 % faster . ) ColorView is another shareware entry ( $ 30 ) . This was an early and promising contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG . If you want to try it anyway , the current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file pub / pc / win 3 / desktop / cview097.zip . ( I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS . ) DVPEG ( see DOS heading ) also works under Windows , but only in full-screen mode , not in a window . OS / 2 : The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu ( 128.123 . 35.151 ) . Note : check / pub / uploads for more recent versions - - - the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / jpegv4.zip 32 - bit version of free IJG conversion programs , version 4 . / pub / os2 / all / graphics / jpeg4-16.zip 16 - bit version of same , for OS / 2 1 . x . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / imgarc12.zip Image Archiver 1.02 : image conversion / viewing with PM graphical interface . Strong on conversion functions , viewing is a bit weaker . Shareware , $ 15 . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / pmjpeg11.zip PMJPEG 1.1 : OS / 2 2 . x port of WinJPEG , a popular viewer for Windows ( see description in Windows section ) . Shareware , $ 20 . / pub / os2 / 2 . x / graphics / pmview85.zip PMView 0.85 : JPEG / GIF / BMP / Targa / PCX viewer . GIF viewing very fast , JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs . Has image manipulation & slideshow functions . Shareware , $ 20 . Macintosh : Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation , which is part of the QuickTime system extension ; so you need to have QuickTime installed . To use QuickTime , you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0 . 7 or later . ( If you're running System 6 , you must also install the 32 - bit QuickDraw extension ; this is built-in on System 7 . ) You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com , file dts / mac / quicktime / quicktime.hqx . ( As of 11/92 , this file contains QuickTime 1.5 , which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways . With respect to JPEG , it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file . However , some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5 . ) Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format , PICT / JPEG , is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format . ( See section 10 for details . ) If you post images on Usenet , make sure they are in JFIF format . Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format . The first choice is probably JPEGView , a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format , PICT / JPEG format , or GIF format . It also can convert between the two JPEG formats . The current version , 2.0 , is a big improvement over prior versions . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu ( 36.44 . 0.6 ) , file / info-mac / app / jpeg-view-20.hqx . Requires System 7 and QuickTime . On 8 - bit displays , JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers . JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers ; in fact , it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac . Given a large image , JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers . ( You can zoom in on any desired portion , though . ) Some people like this behavior , some don't . Overall , JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out . GIFConverter , a shareware ( $ 40 ) image viewer / converter , supports JFIF and PICT / JPEG , as well as GIF and several other image formats . The latest version is 2.3 . 2 . Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file / info-mac / art / gif / gif-converter-232.hqx . Requires System 6.0 . 5 or later . GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG / GIF viewer , but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images . Also , the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images * without * QuickTime , so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime . ( But it's faster with QuickTime . ) Note : If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG , try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert , then viewing the GIF version . JPEG Convert , a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities , is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file / info-mac / app / jpeg-convert-10.hqx . This will run on any Mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing . You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer . Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0 . 6 , a JPEG <=> GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code . If you are using this program , you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert . Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF , QuickTime JPEG , and GIF format , and can convert between these formats . You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com , file dts / mac / quicktime / qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx . Requires QuickTime . PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool , and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime . Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 - bit display , and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface . Worse , PictPixie is an unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix . ( There is an old version of PictPixie , called PICTCompressor , floating around the net . If you have this you should trash it , as it's even buggier . Also , the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor . Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net . ) Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer / converter . This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime , so you may be forced to use it on older systems . ( It does need 32 - bit QuickDraw , so really old machines can't use it . ) You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu , file / info-mac / app / picture-decompress-201.hqx . You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to ' JPEG ' to allow Picture Decompress to open it . If your machine is too old to run 32 - bit QuickDraw ( a Mac Plus for instance ) , GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing . If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter , use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer . More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG , although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format . Adobe Photoshop , version 2.0 . 1 or later , can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files ( use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu ) . You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to ' JPEG ' to allow Photoshop to recognize it . Amiga : ( Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( 130.60 . 80.80 ) . There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one . In the USA , a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu ; look under / mirrors / amiga.physik.unizh.ch/ ... ) HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer / converter , as well as being a general image manipulation tool . It's cheap ( shareware , $ 20 ) and can read several formats besides JPEG . The current version is 2.0 . 8 . A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga / gfx / edit / hamlab208d.lha . The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional . Rend 24 ( shareware , $ 30 ) is an image renderer that can display JPEG , ILBM , and GIF images . The program can be used to create animations , even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave . The current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga / os30 / gfx / rend105.lha . ( Note : although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs , the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1 . ) Viewtek is a free JPEG / ILBM / GIF / ANIM viewer . The current version is 1.04 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) , file amiga / gfx / show / ViewTek104.lha . If you're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages that support JPEG . Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel , the author of Rend 24 and Viewtek . These are CineMorph , a standalone image morphing package , and ImageFX , an impressive 24 - bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting , effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph . Both are distributed by Great Valley Products . Art Department Professional ( ADPro ) , from ASDG Inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas . ImageMaster , from Black Belt Systems , is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support . The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch ( and mirror sites ) in directory amiga / gfx / conv , file AmigaJPEGV4.lha . These programs convert JPEG to / from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs , many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software ( thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month , without so much as notifying the authors ) . Among these are " AugJPEG " , " NewAmyJPEG " , " VJPEG " , and probably others I have not even heard of . In my opinion , anything older than IJG version 3 ( March 1992 ) is not worth the disk space it's stored on ; if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer . Atari ST : The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST , TT , etc , from atari.archive.umich.edu , file / atari / Graphics / jpeg4bin.zoo . These programs convert JPEG to / from PPM , GIF , Targa formats . For monochrome ST monitors , try MGIF , which manages to achieve four-level grayscale effect by flickering . Version 4.1 reads JPEG files . Available from atari.archive.umich.edu , file / atari / Graphics / mgif41b.zoo . I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for Ataris , but surely there must be some by now ? Pointers appreciated . Acorn Archimedes : ! ChangeFSI , supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format . Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG , although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking . Recent versions ( since 7.11 ) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG , along with about 30 other image formats . While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by registering with the author , John Kortink , Nutterbrink 31 , 7544 WJ , Enschede , The Netherlands . Price 35 Dutch guilders ( about $ 22 or 10 pounds ) . There's also a commercial product called ! JPEG which provides JPEG read / write functionality and direct JPEG viewing , as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options . This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs . Contact : DT Software , FREEPOST , Cambridge , UK . Tel : 0223 8410 99 . NeXT : ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format conversions . The current version reads JPEG but does not write it . ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu , somewhere in / pub / next ( both are currently being re-organized , so it's hard to point to specific sub-directories ) . Note that there is an older version floating around that does not support JPEG . Portable software for almost any system : If none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B . You'll also need a viewer program . If your display is 8 bits or less , any GIF viewer will do fine ; if you have a display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24 - bit image files . There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings , with more popping up every day . I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow . In that case , purchase a hardware-assisted product . Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format ; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files . [ 6B ] If you are looking for source code to work with : Free , portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group , which I lead . A package containing our source code , documentation , and some small test files is available from several places . The " official " archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net ( 137.39 . 1.9 or 192.48 . 96.9 ) . Look under directory / graphics / jpeg ; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar . Z . ( This is a compressed TAR file ; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode . ) You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP . If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with . tar . Z format , you may prefer ZIP format , which you can find at Simtel 20 and mirror sites ( see NOTE above ) , file msdos / graphics / jpegsrc4.zip . This file will also be available on CompuServe , in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum ( GO PICS ) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip . If you have no FTP access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive ; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34 . ( If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the FAQ article " How to find sources " , referred to at the top of section 6 . ) The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG " JFIF " format and image files in GIF , PBMPLUS PPM / PGM , Utah RLE , and Truevision Targa file formats . The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs , such as image viewers . The package is highly portable ; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays . We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use . Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products . We do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature ( see the README file in the distribution for details ) . We hope to make this software industrial-quality - - - although , as with anything that's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability . The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization ; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software , you are welcome to join . [ 7 ] What's all this hoopla about color quantization ? Most people don't have full-color ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardware . Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time . To display a full-color image , the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors . This process is called " color quantization " . ( This is something of a misnomer , " color selection " would be a better term . We're stuck with the standard usage though . ) Clearly , color quantization is a lossy process . It turns out that for most images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG ( except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings ) . Since JPEG is a full-color format , converting a color JPEG image for display on 8 - bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization . This is true for * all * color JPEGs : even if you feed a 256 - or-less-color GIF into JPEG , what comes out of the decompressor is * not * 256 colors , but thousands of colors . This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors . Each original color gets " smeared " into a group of nearby colors . Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display , regardless of the image source . The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output . ( Incidentally , because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image . Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values , different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences . I occasionally see posted images described as " 256 - color JPEG " . This tells me that the poster ( a ) hasn't read this FAQ and ( b ) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF . JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale ( just like photographs ) , but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG . ) On the other hand , a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors . ( A GIF * does * have a definite number of colors in its palette , and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries . ) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution , GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients don't have to . This is also the * disadvantage * of GIF : you're stuck with the sender's quantization . If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display , you have to re-quantize , resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image . Furthermore , if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm , you're out of luck . For this reason , JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware . JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware . Furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms ( there is a lot of active research in this area ) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of JPEG images you already have . With a GIF , you're stuck forevermore with what was sent . It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines . If you view a 256 - color GIF on a 16 - color EGA display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to . This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations ( one to create the GIF , one to display it ) , but often it's also due to sloppiness . JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed . Thus , JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones ! Finally , an ever-growing number of people have better-than - 8 - bit display hardware already : 15 - bit " hi-color " PC displays , true 24 - bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes , etc . For these people , GIF is already obsolete , as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display . JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively . Thus , JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion . [8 ] How does JPEG work ? The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine transforms , coefficient quantization , and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding . This article's long enough already , so I'm not going to say more than that here . For technical information , see the comp.compression FAQ . This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files / pub / usenet / news.answers/compression-faq/part [ 1-3 ] . If you need help in using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article . [ 9 ] What about lossless JPEG ? There's a great deal of confusion on this subject . The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i . e . , one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input . However , this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy JPEG algorithm , and it offers much less compression . At present , very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist , and all of them are commercial . Saying " - Q 100 " to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image . What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step . There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step . ( With the V4 free JPEG code , you can also say " - sample 1x1 " to turn off subsampling . Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file . ) Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations . The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value ; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image . At this minimum-loss setting , regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24 - bit-per-pixel image . True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy . If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel ( per color component ) , you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard . This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images . JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel ; furthermore , JPEG is public domain ( at least with a Huffman back end ) , while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents . [ 10 ] Why all the argument about file formats ? Strictly speaking , JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms ; it does * not * refer to a specific image file format . The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations . Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format , this leaves us with a problem . In the absence of official standards , a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to " do their own thing " , and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's . The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems . They have defined two JPEG-based file formats : * JFIF ( JPEG File Interchange Format ) , a " low-end " format that transports pixels and not much else . * TIFF / JPEG , aka TIFF 6.0 , an extension of the Aldus TIFF format . TIFF is a " high-end " format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides :-) . TIFF is a lot more complex than JFIF , and may well prove less transportable , because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of TIFF . It's not likely that adding JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation . Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products ; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards . I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings . JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now ; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details . Even when TIFF / JPEG is well defined , the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported " lowest common denominator " ; TIFF / JPEG files may never be as transportable . A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh . QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure . Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward , and several Mac programs are available to do it ( see Mac portion of section 6A ) . If you have an editor that handles binary files , you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand ; see section 11 for details . Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs ( GIF 2JPG / JPG 2GIF and Image Alchemy ) . These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format . By default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by HSI . This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings . Use the - j switch to get JFIF output . ( This applies to old versions of these programs ; the current releases emit JFIF format by default . You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms . ) [ 11 ] How do I recognize which file format I have , and what do I do about it ? If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read , it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format . You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file : 1 . A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters ( hex ) FF D8 FF E0 , followed by two variable bytes ( often hex 00 10 ) , followed by ' JFIF ' . 2 . If you see FF D8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a " raw JPEG " file . This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software - - - it's worth a try , anyway . 3 . HSI files start with ' hsi 1 ' . You're out of luck unless you have HSI software . Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data , but they won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs . 4 . A Macintosh PICT file , if JPEG-compressed , will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a JFIF header ( scan for ' JFIF ' ) . Strip off everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it . 5 . Anything else : it's a proprietary format , or not JPEG at all . If you are lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream . If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream ( look for FF D8 ) , try stripping off everything before that . In uuencoded Usenet postings , the characteristic JFIF pattern is " begin " line M_ ] C_X ... whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with " begin " line M : ' - I ... If you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files . [ 12 ] What about arithmetic coding ? The JPEG spec defines two different " back end " modules for the final output of compressed data : either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed . The choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file . On typical images , arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding . ( All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding . ) Unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM , AT & T , and Mitsubishi . Thus * you cannot legally use arithmetic coding * unless you obtain licenses from these companies . ( The " fair use " doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best . ) At least in the short run , I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding ; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles . In particular , arithmetic coding * should not * be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet . There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future . Stay tuned for further details . [ 13 ] Does loss accumulate with repeated compression / decompression ? It would be nice if , having compressed an image with JPEG , you could decompress it , manipulate it ( crop off a border , say ) , and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially . Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE . In general , recompressing an altered image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the first time around . The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it * without changing it * then there is no further loss , i . e . , you get an identical JPEG file . Even this is not true ; at least , not with the current free JPEG software . It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error . If you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output . ( It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change . ) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited , but I am not optimistic about it . In any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg , at the original quality setting , would introduce no further loss . Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation . ( If you're wondering why , it's because the pixel-block boundaries move . If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but that's a mighty limited capability ! ) The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images , but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps . Use a lossless format ( PPM , RLE , TIFF , etc ) while working on the image , then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away . Aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot of compression / decompression time this way :-) . [ 14 ] What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG ? As stated earlier , you * will * lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG . If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from , it's far better to make a JPEG from that . But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from , here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality . The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG , to make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding GIF ; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary . Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs , as explained in section 3 ; in particular , cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well . You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be * larger * than the GIF . ( So check the sizes too . ) Experience to date suggests that large , high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG . They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings , and they convert to JPEG with least degradation . Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes . Also , don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals . To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be ( i . e . , shoot for 1/2 or 1/3 rd the size of the GIF file , not 1/4 th as suggested in earlier comparisons ) . Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image . While useless , this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files . It is NOT free in JPEG files , and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ( " ghost " edges ) . Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing . ( If you are on an X Windows system , XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this . ) cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input , but for GIF inputs , Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation . ( If you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher Q setting may not be necessary . ) Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually " dithered " to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store . If you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors ; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value . The trouble with dithering is that , to JPEG , it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise ; and JPEG can't compress noise very well . The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image ( if you had it ) . To get around this , you want to " smooth " the GIF image before compression . Smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble . Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor , thus further reducing the size of the compressed file , while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing . With the V4 free JPEG software ( or products based on it ) , a simple smoothing capability is built in . Try " - smooth 10 " or so when converting GIFs . Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs . Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors . ( If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement , then strong smoothing is definitely called for . ) Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image , which you don't want . If you are an image processing wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package . However , cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol ... The upshot of all this is that " cjpeg - quality 85 - smooth 10 " is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs . But if you really care about the image , you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings . - - - For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular , contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net . - - tom lane organizer , Independent JPEG Group Internet : tgl@cs.cmu.edu BITNET : tgl % cs.cmu . edu @carnegieFrom : renes@ecpdsharmony.cern.ch ( Rene S .

Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing ; in this case a boat , but it could be anything . On the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x , y positions are known . Now you digitize the drawing manually ( in this case , using Yaron Danon's excellent Digitize program ) . That is , you use a program which converts cursor positions to x , y and saves those values when you click the mouse . Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values . This is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper , errors introduced in the printing process , scanner errors and what have you . The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing , so " global " adjustments such as stretching / contracting uniformly over x or y , or rotating the whole drawing , are not satisfactory . So the question is : does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion ? In particular , if I have three sets of points Reference ( x , y ) ( the known true values ) DistortedReference ( x , y ) ( the same points , with known errors ) DistortedData ( x , y ) ( other points , with unknown errors ) what function of Reference and Distorted could I apply to DistortedData to remove the errors . I suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a " bumpy " 3d surface , solving for the surface and then " flattening " it to remove the errors in the other data points .

That's a typical claim , though they say they've improved compression speed considerably . Did you find out anything else about the book ? I'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me any pointers . Reportedly , early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used that marvelous piece of hardware called " grad students " to do the work .

Since this was posted on comp.ai , I assume there is an AI angle to this . Hacking is what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else , e . g . thesis research & write up , getting their supervisors ' pet programs to run properly , etc . No-one gets much glory for hacking , and no-one gets any money out of it . Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that not many people can , or want to , afford - particularly during a recession . In addition , over the last 10 years , I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing running programs in AI research , and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to problem-solving . Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs . At a conference a year or two ago , Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should ' Get back to the keyboard ' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas - and I have to say I'm inclined to agree .

Note the early use of PostScript technology , predating many of this year's papers listed in the April 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago . - - Eric Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon ( UNDECIDABLE ? ? ) , by Dave Baraff , Tom Duff From : deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu Newsgroups : comp.graphics Keywords : P , NP , Jordan curve separation , Ursyhon Metrization Theorem Organization : Program of Computer Graphics In article [ ... ] ncsmith@ndsuvax.UUCP ( Timothy Lyle Smith ) writes : > > I need to find a formula / algorithm to determine if a line intersects > a polygon . I would prefer a method that would do this in as little > time as possible . I need this for use in a forward raytracing > program . I think that this is a very difficult problem . To start with , lines and polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of points . Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas . First , we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated . Now , the Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into exactly two open ( and thus non-compact ) regions . Thus , the line lies completely inside the polygon , the line lies completely outside the polygon , or possibly ( but this will rarely happen ) the line intersects the polyon . Now , the phrasing of this question says " if a line intersects a polygon " , so this is a decision problem . One possibility ( the decision model approach ) is to reduce the question to some other ( well known ) problem Q , and then try to solve Q . An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem . In recent years , many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a new language called PostScript . ( See " PostScript Language " , by Adobe Systems Incorporated , ISBN # 0-201-1017 9-3 , co . 1985 ) . So , given a line L and a polygon P , we can write a PostScript program that draws the line L and the polygon P , and then " outputs " the answer . By " output " , we mean the program executes a command called " showpage " , which actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon . A quick examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q , and thus the original problem . There are two small problems with this approach . ( 1 ) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the reduced problem Q . So , we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of Choice ( or equivalently , Zorn's Lemma ) . But the use of the Axiom of Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days . ( 2 ) More importantly , the question arises as to whether or not the PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper ; or in other words , will it halt ? Now , PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem ( for PostScript ) is undecidable . It is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable . I won't even begin to go into other difficulties , such as aliasing , finite precision and running out of ink , paper or both . A couple of references might be : 1 . Principia Mathematica .

Organization : AT & T Bell Laboratories , Murray Hill NJ The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests ( he should know better , he's hung around The Labs for long enough ) . By the well known Dobbin-Dullman reduction ( see J . Dullman & D . Dobbin , J . Comp . Obfusc . 37 , ii : pp . 33-947 , lemma 17 ( a ) ) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to Hamiltonian Circuit , without ( ! ) the use of Grobner bases , so LPI ( to coin an acronym ) is probably only NP-complete . Besides , Turing-completeness will no longer be a problem once our Cray - 3 is delivered , since it will be able to complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds ( with scatter-gather . ) - - - From : deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu ( David Baraff ) Well , sure its no worse than NP-complete , but that's ONLY if you restrict yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its second derivative . ( I think there's an ' 89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that deals with this ) . - - - - - J o n a s Y n g v e s s o n email : jonas-y@isy.liu.se Dept . of Electrical Engineering voice : + 46 - ( 0 ) 13-282162 University of Linkoping , Sweden fax : + 46 - ( 0 ) 13-139282From : grieggs@jpl-devvax.jpl.nasa.gov ( John T .

A list of computer graphics , computational geometry and image processing journals is available from Juhana Kouhia , jk87377@cs.tut.fi . 2 ) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen . The simple answer is , you divide by the depth . For a more verbose explanation , see any of the above references , starting with : The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes " Computer Graphics " book is certainly a good start . Chapter 6 is " Viewing in 3D " , then read chapter 15 , " Visible-Surface Determination " . For more information go to chapter 16 for shading , chapter 19 for clipping , and branch out from there . 3 ) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits . Find a copy of " Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display " by Paul Heckbert , SIGGRAPH ' 82 Proceedings , page 297 . There are other algorithms , but this one works well and is fairly simple . Implementations are included in most raster toolkits ( see item 7 below ) . A variant method is described in " Graphics Gems " , p . 287-293 . Note that the code from the " Graphics Gems " series is all available from an FTP site , as described above . Check out John Bradley's " Diversity Algorithm " , which is incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the manual . The ImageMagick package ( see section 7 for where it is ) contains another quantizing algorithm which is presented as " doing a better job than the other algorithms , but slower " . There's also an implementation of : Wan , Wong , and Prusinkiewicz , _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data Clustering _ , Transactions on Mathematical Software , Vol . 14 # 2 ( June , 1988 ) , pp . 153-162 . avialable as princeton.edu :p ub / Graphics / colorquant.shar . This code , in modified form , appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well . 4 ) Converting color into grayscale . The NTSC formula is : luminosity = . 299 red + . 587 green + . 114 blue 5 ) Quantizing grayscale to black & white . The only reference you need for this stuff is : Digital Halftoning , Robert Ulichney , MIT Press 1987 , ISBN 0-262-2100 9-6 But before you go off and start coding , check out the image manipulation software mentioned in item 7 below . All of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b & w conversion . 6 ) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle . The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image , transform each coordinate , and copy the pixel to the destination . This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination . Instead , loop over the pixels in the destination image , apply the * reverse * transformation to the coordinates , and copy that pixel from the source . This method is quite general , and can be used for any one-to-one 2 - D mapping , not just rotation . You can add anti-aliasing by doing sub-pixel sampling . However , there is a much faster method , with antialising included , which involves doing three shear operations . The method was originally created for the IM Raster Toolkit ( see below ); an implementation is also present in PBMPLUS . Reference : " A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation " , by Alan Paeth ( awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu ) Graphics Interface ' 86 ( Vancouver ) . An article on the IM toolkit appears in the same journal . An updated version of the rotation paper appears in " Graphics Gems " ( see section [ 1 ] ) under the original title . 7 ) Free image manipulation software . There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to another , doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling , plus the above-mentioned 24 -> 8 , color -> gray , gray -> b & w conversions . Here are pointers to some of them : xv by John Bradley . X-based image display , manipulation , and format conversion package .

" There are a number of automated mail servers that will send you things like this in response to a message . See item 13 below for details on some . Also , the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this . You may find useful information there . 8) Format documents for TIFF , IFF , BIFF , NFF , OFF , FITS , etc . You almost certainly don't need these . Read the above item 7 on free image manipulation software . Get one or more of these packages and look through them . Chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there . But if you still want one of the format documents , many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub / graphics.formats . These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct . This archive includes pixel formats , and two - and three-dimensional object formats . The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment , as Mark Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it . A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by Quincey Koziol ( koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu ) . The latest version exists at ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in / misc / file.formats/graphics.formats . Apparently , neither of these is complete , you might want to check both . FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System . It's a file format most often used in astronomy . Despite the name , it can contain not only images but other things as well . There is a regular monthly FITS basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more . 9 ) Converting between vector formats . A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript , or MacDraw to CGM , or whatever . It is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item 7 . Converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem , since once you get past all the file header junk , a pixel is a pixel - - the basic objects are the same for all image formats . This is not so for vector formats . The basic objects - - circles , ellipses , drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered rectangles , etc . - - vary from one format to another . Except in extremely restricted cases , it is simply not possible to do a one-to-one conversion between vector formats . There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu . The contributor states that it runs on Unix , MS-Windows , and possibly the Mac . A better , more specific blurb would be most welcome . On the other hand , it is quite possible to do a close approximation , rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another . As far as I know , no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters , but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been posted to comp.sources.misc . Check the index on your nearest archive site . A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format , or HPGL to X11 bitmap . For example , some of the commercial PostScript clones for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer . Also , the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11 / NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever . But in general , the answer is no . However , if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit , adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial . GNU ghostscript ( from the FSF - current version 2.5 . 2 ) includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files , thus it can be used as a PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter . ( It implements essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript and level 2 ) . 10 ) How to get Pixar films .

Or , just write to : Direct Cinema Limited 1749 14th Street Santa Monica , CA 90404-4342 Allan Braunsdorf has this to say : At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts for $ 25 . That was a sale price . You can get it for slightly more than that normally . ( $ 35 maybe . ) I believe it's available from RenderMan Retail ( at Pixar's address ) . Pixar 1001 West Cutting Blvd . Richmond , CA . 94804 (510) 236-4000 (510) 236-0388 ( FAX ) You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains " Luxo , Jr . " , " Red's Dream " , " Tin Toy " and " Knicknack " for $ 25.00 , plus $ 2.50 for shipping . They will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card . I ordered mine just last week and received it several days later . Don't expect to be able to rent a copy from your local video store . According to the license agreement printed on the back cover of the case , it cannot be rented . 11 ) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier ( or B-spline ) curve ? The short answer is , " You can't . " Unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle . The approximation may look acceptable , but it is sensitive to scale . Magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies . Deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large . If you want to do the job right , consult the article : " A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles " by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications , volume 9 , number 9 , September , 1989 , pages 48-56 . For rough , non-rational approximations , consult the book : Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture by I . D . Faux and M . J . Pratt , Ellis Horwood Publishers , Halsted Press , John Wiley 1980 . For the best known non-rational approximations , consult the article : " Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves " by Tor Dokken , Morten Daehlen , Tom Lyche , and Knut Morken in Computer Aided Geometric Design , volume 7 , numbers 1-4 ( combined ) , June , 1990 , pages 33-41 [ Elsevier Science Publishers ( North-Holland ) ] 12 ) How to order standards documents . The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards , and also ISO ( international ) standards . Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900 , mailing address is 1430 Broadway , NY NY 10018 . It helps if you have the complete name and number . Some useful numbers to know : CGM ( Computer Graphics Metafile ) is ISO 8632-4 ( 1987 ) . GKS ( Graphical Kernel System ) is ANSI X3 . 124-1985 . PHIGS ( Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System ) is ANSI X3 . 144-1988 . IGES is ASME / ANSI Y14 . 26M - 1987 . Language bindings are often separate but related numbers ; for example , the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3 . 124.1- 1985 . Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit comments from the graphical public ( this includes you ! ) . ANSI can let you know where to order them ; most are available from Global Engineering at 1-800-854-7179 . 13 ) How to FTP by email . There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups and make them available via an email query system . You send a message to an automated server saying something like " send comp.sources.unix/fbm " , and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail . In addition , there is at least one FTP-by-mail server . Send mail to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying " help " and it will tell you how to use it . Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse . 14 ) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon . Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity . If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way , the point is within the polygon . If the ray crosses an even number of edges , the point is either outside the polygon , or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges . This idea is known in the trade as the Jordan curve theorem ; see Eric Haines ' article in Glassner's ray tracing book ( above ) for more information , including treatment of special cases . Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon . If the sum is 2 pi , the point is inside , if the sum is 0 the point is outside . However , this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly . Code for both methods ( plus barycentric triangle testing ) can be found in the Ray Tracing News , Vol . 5 , No . 3 , available from princeton.edu : pub / Graphics / RTNews / RTNv 5n3 . Z . 15 ) How to tessellate a sphere . One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles . The base of the recursion is an octahedron , and then each level divides each triangle into four smaller ones . Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu> has posted a nice routine called sphere . c that generates the coordinates . It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu . 16 ) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination . Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography : Highlights of this edition - i ) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through November ' 91 ; ii ) papers from all Siggraph , Graphics Interface , Eurographics , CG International and Ausgraph proceedings through December , ' 91 ; iii ) all citations keyworded for easy lookup ; iv ) cross-indices by keyword and author ; v ) glossary of the 119 keywords used . The bib is in the form of a PostScript file . The printout is 41 pages long . Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file . It's named " speer.raytrace.bib.ps . Z " and is compressed at most sites - Site Dir wuarchive.wustl.edu graphics / graphics / bib / RT.BIB.Speer/ karazm.math.uh.edu pub / Graphics / gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au pub / papers / nic.funet.fi pub / sci / papers / graphics coral.cs.jcu.edu.au graphics / papers / Eric Haines ( erich@eye.com ) maintains ray tracing and radiosity / global illumination bibliographies . These are in " refer " format , and so can be searched electronically ( a simple awk script to search for keywords is included with each ) . The bibliographies are available at most of the sites listed above , and the most current versions are maintained at princeton.edu : pub / Graphics / Papers as " RayBib . * " and " RadBib . * " . Tom Wilson ( wilson@cs.ucf.edu ) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray tracing related research papers and books . The information is essentially in plaintext , and Latex and troff formatting programs are included . This collection is available at most of the sites above as " rtabs . * " . 17 ) SIGGRAPH information online [ from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick ] ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at siggraph.org ( 128.248 . 245.250 ) . This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server . The anonymous ftp service is very standard , and the ftp directory includes both conference and publications subdirectories . To retrieve information by electronic mail , send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the message include the message send followed by the topic and subtopic you wish . A good place to start is with the command send index which will give you an up-to-date list of available information . 18 ) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available [ from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd ] ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH ' 91 Panels Proceedings at the siggraph.org site ( 128.248 . 245.250 ) . The proceedings are available in three formats : text ( ASCII ) rtf ( rich text format , suitable for many word processors ) word ( MS Word for the Macintosh ) They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways : ( 1 ) by anonymous ftp change to one of the directories publications / s91 / panels_proceedings / [ text | rtf | word ] The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode , while the word files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary mode . Each directory contains a Table of Contents file ( TOC ) that describes the contents of each panel file . ( 2 ) by electronic mail send mail to archive-server@siggraph.org You can retrieve either the text or rtf files . We suggest that you first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages send panel 91 - txt index send panel 91 - rtf index in the subject or body of the message . You will get the necessary information to retrieve the actual transcript files . 19 ) Graphics mailing lists There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there , each covering either a single product or a single topic . I have been an active participant in one of these for some time now , and find the focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic to be nothing short of amazing . Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you would like to see added .

Comments - 26 formats , no software ( this is good , IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent ) . Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us . 21 ) What about GIF ? GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format . It is portable and usable upon a wide variety of platforms . It is quite limited in some ways ( yes , the keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all ) , and in fact , I don't like it much . However , it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question which was not previously covered in this list . The following is a list of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF . Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info Subject : alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info Newsgroups : alt.binaries.pictures . d , alt.binaries.pictures.misc , alt.binaries.pictures.utilities , alt.binaries.pictures.fractals , alt.binaries.pictures.fine - art . d , news.answers Available in the indicated USENET newsgroup ( s ) , or via anonymous ftp from pit-manager.mit.edu in the files : / pub / usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 / pub / usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Also available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail message containing any or all of : send usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part1 send usenet / news.answers/pictures-faq/part2 Send a message containing " help " to get general information about the mail server . Also , you could check out the resources described in sections 7 , 8 , and 20 above for more information . 22 ) What is morphing ? Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new location . Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one . Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and morphing . This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory pub / graphics / bibliography / Morph . There are three files : morph_intro . ps . Z ( PostScript version , many pictures - 1.5 M ) morph_intro . txt . Z ( text version ) m_responses . Z ( Responses to morphing questions ) The files are compressed , so you must use binary transfer and uncompress them afterwards . 23 ) How to ray-trace height fields Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing . They have a number of uses , such as terrain rendering , and some optimization is possible . Thus , they get their own FAQ section . Note that further references can no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above . The following paper seems to be the definitive reference : F . Kenton Musgrave Grid Tracing : Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields July , 1988 <musg88.ps.Z> This is available as " Research Report YALEU / DCS / RR - 639 " from Yale University , it's also in the SIGGRAPH ' 91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes , and ( best of all ) it's available on the net : nic.funet.fi pub / sci / papers / musg88.ps .

Pn , not in the x-y plane , is given by Area ( Polygon ) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk + 1 } | where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal vertex . The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents the cross product operator . Sigma represents the summation operator . | | represents the absolute value operator . Pn + 1 is equal to P0 . 25 ) How to join ACM / SIGGRAPH Probably the easiest way to join ACM / SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM .

Thanks . dkusswur@falcon.depaul.eduFrom : lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com ( LightWave 3D Mail List Administrator ) Subject : Monthly LightWave mailing list FAQ - - - LightWave 3D Mail-List - - - - - WHAT IS LightWave ? - - LightWave 3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a device called the " Toaster " ( from NewTek , Inc . ) that operates on an Amiga platform . The LightWave software ( LightWave = LightWave 3D and LightWave Modeler ) allows and artist to create three dimensional photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes . - - WHY ARE WE DOING THIS ? - - This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software , how it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images available to them . The list is for those who own the Toaster and LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the package . We hope to share information , tips , procedures and to bond as a group . - - WHAT ARE THE RULES ? - - Since LightWave / Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster software , I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation of the Toaster . However , we will strive to keep the subject revolving specifically around the 3D software , related tools and products . You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list ! - - OK ! HOW DO I JOIN ? - - To become a member of the LightWave 3D mailing list you must send a mail message to the address : lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter : subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list . At this point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated script based system in place soon . There shouldn't be too much of a delay in joining . Expect a " welcome " message within 5 days after you send your request . Then , expect the mail to start flowing in ! - - HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST ? - - Contributing to the list is simple . Just mail your articles to the following address : lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all others joined to the list . Your articles will also be sent to you so you know that your article has made it to the list . However , those addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back to you . So , if you post an article and another members address is no longer valid , your original article will be returned to you . This doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list . In fact , just the opposite is true . It means that your article WAS posted and that it couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad address . NOTE : I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon . - - HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST ? - - Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address you used to sign up : lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com In the body of the message enter : unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain I will remove your name from the list of members . PLEASE , if you join the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be able to receive mail for a while , send a request to be removed from the list ! If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend forwarding of the articles to you . - - WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES ? - - I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the originating site ( bobsbox ) . However , I can not continue to do this due to lack of disk space . What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a compendium of articles sent to the list . They can compress and store them in archives on their system . They can then periodically post an index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that relates . If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI hard drive to me for archival purposes . <grin> I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past articles , the membership listing and other information pertaining to the LightWave 3D mailing list . For information on this service , please send a mail message to : fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com The first command to the server must be " HELP " or " USER name <passwd> " . Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile . Use USER name [ passwd ] to connect to the service . Use ? to get a short listing of all available commands . - - NOW WHAT DO I DO ? - - Well , sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information . If you have something to offer , please feel free to contribute that information to the list . Every little bit helps . Questions are welcomed ! It makes some of us feel important when we can answer them . <grin> If you have any questions or comments regarding the list , please contact me at the address : lightwave-admin@bobsbox.rent.com Cheers , Bob LindaburyFrom : tom@inferno.UUCP ( Tom Sherwin ) Subject : Re : XV under MS-DOS ? ! ? | > Hi ...

A 3DO marketing rep . recently offered a Phillips marketing rep . a $ 100 bet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule . The Phillips rep . declined the bet , probably because he knew that 3DO players are already in pre-production manufacturing runs , 6 months before the commercial release date . By the time of commercial release , there will be other manufacturers of 3DO players announced and possibly already tooling up production . Chip sets will be in full production . The number of software companies designing titles for the box will be over 300 . How do I know this ? I was at a bar down the road from 3DO headquarters last week .

Can read TIFF images , if you know their dimensions [ PC and Macs ] LabVIEW 2 - - - LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools . It provides a graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the " program " with graphical elements representing the programming elements . Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a wiring tool to create the block diagram ( program ) . Functions that the block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and filtering , numerical analysis , statistics , etc . The tool allows any Virtual Instrument ( VI , a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument ) to be used as a part of any other virtual instrument . National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing ( DSP ) boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time acquisition and analysis at a personal computer . New software tools for DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology . The tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block diagram development software . There are three levels of DSP programming associated with the NB-DSP 2300 board and LabVIEW : Use of the NB-DSP 2300 Analysis Library : FFTs , power spectra , filters routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop ( MPW ) C that execute on the NB-DSP 2300 board . There is an analysis Virtual Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP 2300 . Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an optimizing C compiler , an assembler and a linker for low-level programming of the DSP hardware . This approach offers the highest level of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use . Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has utility functions for memory management data communications and downloading code to the NB-DSP 2300 board . ( This is the easiest route for the development of custom code . ) Ultimage Concept VI - - - Concept VI by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual Instruments ( VIs ) that give LabVIEW 2 ( described above ) users high-end tools for designing , integrating and monitoring imaging control systems . A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory instrument . Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography , surveillance , machine vision , production testing , biomedical imaging , electronic microscopy and remote sensing . Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further qualitative and quantitative analysis . It includes a complete set of functions for image enhancement , histogram equalization , spatial and frequency filtering , isolation of features , thresholding , mathematical morphology analysis , density measurement , object counting , sizing and characterization . The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 , a pixel depth of 8 , 16 , or 32 bits , and one image plane . Standard input and output formats include PICT , TIFF , SATIE , and AIPD . Other formats can be imported . Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations , spatial linear and non-linear filters , frequency filtering , arithmetic and logic operations , and geometric transformations , among others . Morphological transformations include erosion , dilation , opening , closing , hole removal , object separation , and extraction of skeletons , among others . Quantitative analysis provides for objects ' detection , measurement , and morphological distribution . Measures include area , perimeter , center of gravity , moment of inertia , orientation , length of relevant chords , and shape factors and equivalence . Measures are saved in ASCII format . The program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom modules . A 3 - D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot . The histogram tool can be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale . The twenty-eight arithmetic and logical operations provide for : masking and averaging sections of images , noise removal , making comparisons , etc . There are 13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local intensity . These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines . The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as either the ( real , imaginary ) components or the ( phase , magnitude ) data . The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening and defining objects or for removing artifacts . The transformations include : thresholding , eroding , dilating and even hole filling . The program's quantitative analysis measurements include : area , perimeter , center of mass , object counts , and angle between points . GTFS , Inc . 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa , CA 95494 707-579-1733 IPLab Spectrum - - - IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI . Using scripting tools , the user tells the system the operations to be performed . The problem is that far too many basic operations require manual intervention . The tool supports : FFTs , 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration , and a movie command for cycling through windows .

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS applications . These include an eraser , pencil , brush and air brush . Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated . For example , all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from being pasted . Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100 % , allowing you to create ghost overlays . RPhoto-editingS tools include control of the brightness and contrast , color balancing , hue / saturation modification and spectrum equalization .

MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines , IA 50322 515-270-8109 Image Analyst - - - An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative data from video images . Image Analyst lets users configure sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the necessity of knowing a programming language . It is designed for such tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video cameras attached to microscopes , or enhancing and measuring distances in radiographs . Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of instructions to enhance feature appearance ; count objects ; determine density , shape , size , position , or movement ; perform object feature extraction ; and conduct textural analysis automatically . Image Analyst works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera , or a disk-stored image . Within minutes , without the need for programming , the Image Analyst user can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image . Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images . Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size , shape and position . The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and Scion frame grabbers . A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices . There are 2 types of files , the image itself and the related Sequence file that holds the processing , measurements and analysis that the user defines . Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest ( ROI ) represented by movable , sizable boxes atop the image . Inside a ROI , the program can find the distance between two edges , the area of a shape , the thickness of a wall , etc . Image Analyst finds the center , edge and other positions automatically . The application also provides tools so that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object . It also supports histograms and a color look-up table ( CLUT ) tool .

Been around for a number of years , sold to Weather Service and Navy . Runs on HP9000 with HP-UX . Supports 24 - bit display " HIPS - - - ( Human Information Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System ) Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications ( robotics , medical , satellite , engineering , oil exploration , etc . ) . It is called HIPS , and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images . It has been growing since we first wrote it , both by additions from us as well as a huge user-contributed library . Feature description HIPS is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research , system development and teaching . It handles sequences of images ( movies ) in precisely the same manner as single frames . Programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations , filtering , convolution , Fourier and other transform processing , edge detection and line drawing manipulation , digital image compression and transmission methods , noise generation , and image statistics computation . Over 150 such image transformation programs have been developed . As a result , almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently . Additionally , HIPS allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines . New users become effective using HIPS on their first day . HIPS features images that are self-documenting . Each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image . HIPS includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header , and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of UNIX ` ` filters ' ' . It comes complete with source code , on-line manual pages , and on-line documentation . Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University , HIPS now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available . It runs under the UNIX operating system . It is modular and flexible , provides automatic documentation of its actions , and is almost entirely independent of special equipment . HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and Microvax , Sun , Apollo , Masscomp , NCR Tower , Iris , IBM AT , etc . For image display and input , drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and Adage ( Ikonas ) image processors , and the Sun - 2 , Sun - 3 , Sun - 4 , and Sun - 386i consoles . We also supply user-contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages ( Sun gfx , Sun console , Matrox VIP - 1024 , ITI IP - 512 , Lexidata , Macintosh II , X windowing system , and Iris ) . The Hipsaddon package includes an interface for the CRS - 4000 . It is a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame - stores , and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max - Video . HIPS can be easily adapted for other image display devices because 98 % of HIPS is machine independent . Availability HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible system , both as an interactive research tool , and for more production - oriented tasks . It is both easy to use , and quickly adapted and extended to new uses . HIPS is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format ( either reel - to-reel or Sun cartridge ) , and comes with source code , libraries , a library of convolu - tion masks , and on-line documentation and manual pages .

I also have 340 Pens for it as follows : 10 packs of 4 Black Oil based , 16 packs of 4 Red , Green , Blue , and Black pens , 22 packs of 4 Aqueous Black , 7 packs of 4 Aqueous R , G , Blue , Black , 1 pack of 6 Aqueous Multi color pens , and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored . The plotter is used . I have tested it using the Windows drivers for HP 7570 and HP 7574 and both worked fine . It accepts either A or B sized paper . (8 . 5 x 11 or 11x17 ) . I figure that the plotter is worth about $ 300 and the pens are worth at least another $ 200 more .. One thing is certain , you won't need to purchase any pens for quite a while ... All of the packaged pens were sealed so they are all still fresh . The rest were capped and seem to function as well . I'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in just them . I'm selling it because I got a HP LaserJet and I don't need color . I'd like $ 350 or best offer ... - Chert - - Chert Pellett - chert@dungeon.cirr.com | | chert@dungeon.lonestar.org PANIC : The cat is nibbling on the power cord !From : lmp8913@rigel.tamu.edu ( PRESTON , LISA M ) Subject : Another CVIEW question ( was CView answers ) Has anybody gotten CVIEW to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a Trident 8900c hi-color card ?

There might be an IPAS routine that does that , but I can'r be sure . Another way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the image . Then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection . It will take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection , but that's the only thing I can think of .From : <JER114@psuvm.psu.edu> Subject : scanned grey to color equations ? A while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f iltered grey scale images into one true color image . This is possible because it's the same theory used by most color scanners . I am not looking for the obv ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what I do need is those equat ions becasue I am starting to write software which will automate the conversion process . I would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations / 3 unknowns . Thanks for the help ! ! !From : ab@nova.cc.purdue.edu ( Allen B ) Subject : Re : Fractals ? What good are they ?

How does that compare with JPEG on the same images and hardware as far as size , speed , and image quality are concerned ? Despite my skeptical and sometimes nearly rabid postings criticizing Barnsley and company , I am very interested in the technique . If I weren't I probably wouldn't be so critical . :-) abFrom : s127@ii.uib.no ( Torgeir Veimo ) Subject : virtual sound I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound . What i want to do is the following ; From a fast source , eg . a CDROM , several sound sources are read , each having it's own defined position and other attributes , eg . direction etc . Given the listeners position and direction , the sum of sound played back in each of the listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction . This means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's incoming direction have to be done for each sound source . ( I think this is possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles relative to each ear , and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given angle . This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the source . This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source changes position or the listener changes orientation . ) Additionally some reflection , diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined could be simulated , but this requires some sort of sound propagandation simulation , kinda like some radiosity algorithm . Have someone done this and / or written articles on implementing such a system ? Please post or mail any answers or comments . - - Torgeir Veimo Studying at the University of Bergen " ...

Hi , I'm looking for an algorithm that would generate a good cross-section of RGB colours given a limited colour map size . The problem : I'm writing an application for the PC that may have at most 256 colors . I want to use one colormap ( palette ) for the application but I'd like it to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum . I could use a 6x6x6 RGB cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost identical to the human eye .
