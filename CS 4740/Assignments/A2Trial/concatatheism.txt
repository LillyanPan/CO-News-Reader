Values can also refer to meaning . For example in computer science the value of 1 is TRUE , and 0 is FALSE . Science is based on commonly agreed values ( interpretation of observations ) , although science can result in a reinterpretation of these values . > Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are > applicable to everyone . The values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been fully agreed , and the change with time .

If we can't measure anything objectively , then the answers we get from physics aren't objective either . That's what I mean when I say there's no objective physics . Sure , we can all agree that ( say ) F = GMm / r ^ 2 , but that's maths . It's only physics when you relate it to the real world , and if we can't do that objectively , we're stuck .

This sounds an awful lot like an objective > speed-of-light-in-vacuum . ) It's an axiom that it's invariant . But if the two of us measure it , we'll get different answers . Yes , we call that experimental error , but it's not really " error " in the conventional sense ; in fact , if you don't get any , that's an error :-) You could argue that the value of c is " objective , to within + / - < some value > " . But I'd call that a rather odd usage of the word " objective " , and it opens the way for statements like " Murder is objectively wrong for all people , to within 1 % of the total population .

Nevertheless , Khomeini offered a cash prize for people to > take the law into their own hands - - something which , to my > understanding , is against Islamic law . Yes , this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws . However , I believe there are also certain legal rulings which , in all five schools of law ( 4 sunni and 1 jaffari ) , can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims , both within and outside dar-al-islam . I do not know if apostasy ( when accompanied by active , persistent , and open hostility to Islam ) falls into this category of the law . I do know that historically , apostasy has very rarely been punished at all , let alone by the death penalty . My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy ( alone ) . It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an , hadith , or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy . I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of " fasad " . This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals . The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran . > Stuff deleted > Also , I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that > Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book . My > understanding is that Khomeini's fatwa was issued in response to the > _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book . If my view is correct , then > your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a " crime in progress " is > incorrect . > I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa ( from what I remember ) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book . However , the charge of " fasad " can encompass a number of lesser charges . I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author , and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the " crisis " . But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa . Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people , not books . The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa . Rushdie went on a media blitz , presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred . Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book , he was everywhere in the media . Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book . Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned , then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights . It was at this point that the fatwa on " fasad " was issued . The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling . The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers . The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well . The crime was certainly a crime in progress ( at many levels ) and was being played out ( and played up ) in the the full view of the media . P . S . I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of " shatim " also applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the " fasad " ruling .From : madhaus@netcom.com ( Maddi Hausmann ) Subject : Re : Amusing atheists and agnostics timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu ( " Half " Bake Timmons ) writes : > Maddi : > > > > Whirr click whirr ...

How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known > what * not to include * in the Holy Qur'an ( assuming he had authored > it ) ? This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue . The book is in two sections . Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible , showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science . Well we all know that , no surprises . Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories , and seems , on the face of it , to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science . However , it was plain to me , that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran . Take the flood , for example , the bible is full of detail , ( " forty days and forty nights " , " pair of every animal " , etc . ) , we all know this is nonsense . The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as " A big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage " . Yes , no contradiction but also not much fact . The Koran might be consistent with modern science , but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time , does not seem much of an achievement . The book concludes by saying something like , the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of ( to us now ) ridiculous ideas about the universe , and none of them can be found in the Koran ! Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme . The above is , of course , from memory so I may have missed some points . - - Leonard e-mail : L.Newnham@bradford.ac.ukFrom : I3150101@dbstu1.rz.tu-bs.de ( Benedikt Rosenau ) Subject : Re : atheist ?

In other words , I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless . In Ontology , one can fairly conclude that when " A exist " is meaningless A does not exist . Under the Pragmatic definition of truth , " A exists " is meaningless makes A exist even logically false . A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition , and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense . The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all .

So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is if it contradicts the Quran ? What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran ? Also , the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed either . It wasn't long after , but 20 years or so is still long enough to shift a few verses around .

Of course , we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion , but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it .

It sounds as if you are proceeding with just the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of . I always preceeded my statements with " it is my understanding that ... " Now , I have made my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility . After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself , I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim . However , I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams . There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims , which are always made clearly . I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and other such opaque " concepts " often used by people to camoflage the baselessness of their positions , particularly in matters of theology .

When you say ( paraphrased ) #in ( 2 ) that this is not " evidence for [ benefactor ] " , for example , what you #mean is that it's no * more * evidence for [ benefactor ] than it is for [ bug ] . Yes , that's what I mean . #In ( 3 ) , however , you've shifted the meaning of " evidence for [ benefactor ] " #so that it now means ` absolute ' " evidence for [ benefactor ] " rather than # ` relative ' " evidence for [ benefactor ] " w . r . t . [ bug ] . Not really , I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other . I think this is just a communications problem . What I am trying to say , in my clumsy way , is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions ( prayer , your ' Rapture ' example ) , I don't buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A = 0 . In my example , one couldn't dismiss [ benefactor ] or [ bug ] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh . I brought up the ' one-by-one dismissal ' process to show that it would be wrong to do so . From what you're saying in this post , it seems you agree , and we're talking at cross-purposes . # ( 3 ) is still in contradiction to ( 1 ) . # #Some sums may help . With B = benefactor , b = bug , d = dosh arrives in account : # # ( 1 ) implies P ( B + b | d ) = 1 # #Assuming that P ( Bb | d ) = 0 , so it's either the benefactor * or * a bug #which is responsible if the bucks arrive , but not both , then # # P ( B + b | d ) = P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) # #so # # P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) = 1 # #but ( 3 ) implies that # # P ( B | d ) = 0 and P ( b | d ) = 0 . No , this isn't what I meant . P ( B | d ) = 0.5 and P ( b | d ) = 0.5 , with necessarily no new observation ( we've already seen the dosh ) to change those estimates . I was trying to say ( again , in my clumsy way ) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these . And that's precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis ( there are many others ) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explained . It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference , not of science or statistics . Alternatively , one could chuck out or retain the lot , on the grounds that the answer can't be known , or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless , being equal ( agnosticism / weak atheism ) . # > As they do when the set M is filled by " the universe is caused by x " , # > where x is gods , pink unicorns , nothing , etc . - and no observation # > tends to one conclusion over the other . # #Exactly the point I was making , I think .

See my post on the other branch of this #thread . Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of . If the razor holds for gods , then it holds for all like hypotheses . Which means that you're assigning P ( x | H [ i ] ) = 0 for all i , though we've already established that it's not correct to do so when SUM ( P ( x | H [ i ] ) )= 1 over all i . # > Simply put , anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or # > non-existence of gods , whether inductive or no , is at best mistaken , and # > at worst barking mad . # #Luckily I make no such claim , and have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions .

And I'm not constructing a strawman ( though it's certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying ) . However , by any standards , a system that says when A = 0 , gods are highly unlikely , and when A ! = 0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor , is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist , or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena . In my experience , systems such as this ( including those which purport to prove that gods exist ) always contain a fallacy upon close examination .

Bill , I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism . Lack of belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values . I hope you would accept the fact that for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism .

The claims that Jesus have been seen are discredited as extraordinary claims that don't match their evidence .

Ah , now here is the core question . Let me suggest a scenario . We will grant that a God exists , and uses revelation to communicate with humans . ( Said revelation taking the form ( paraphrased from your own words ) ' This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck , makes him take dictation , and then hides away for a few hundred years ' . ) Now , there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation . This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world ( which is all this person has ever seen ) , but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation . Now , based on this , can this person be blamed for concluding , absent a personal revelation of their own , that there is almost certainly nothing to this ' revelation ' thing ? > I'm not an objectivist , so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of > conceptualization .

Absent this better language , and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation , can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing ? Here is what I am driving at : I have thought a long time about this . I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity , it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with . Now , if there does happen to be , say , a Christian God , will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake ? Sincerely , Ray Ingles ingles@engin.umich.edu " The meek can * have * the Earth .

I'll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that I stop , or I run out of good material . I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving attributions . I think the following comes from John A . Johnson , but someone correct me if I'm wrong . This is probably the longest of my entire collection . ___ So that the Prophecy be Fulfilled * * * In considering the Christian religion , and judging it according to its claims , it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy . The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth . As you will see , Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages , often not even about the promised Messiah , and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament . We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts . Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed , we do not know how much happened exactly as stated . But , for purposes of analysis , we will take particular claims at face value . Immanuel : We begin , of course , at the beginning . ( Mt 1.21- 22 ): " [ Mary ] will bear a son , and you , Joseph , will name him ' Jesus ' ( which means G'd is salvation ) , for he will save his people from their sins . " All this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet : [ Isaiah 7.1- 16 ]: In the days of Ahaz ( c . 750 BCE ) , king of Judah , Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made war on Jerusalem ( capitol of Judah ) , but could not quite conquer it . When the house of David ( i . e . Ahaz and his court in Judah ) were told of this , ... its heart and the heart of its people shook ... And , the lord G'd said to Isaiah , " go to meet with Ahaz ... " ... And the lord spoke to Ahaz ( through prophet Isaiah , naturally ) saying , " Ask a sign of G'd your lord . It can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven . " But , Ahaz said , " I won't ask ; I will not put the lord to a test . " Then ( Isaiah ) said , " Hear then , O house of David . Is it not enough for you to weary men , that you must weary my god too ? Therefore , the lord himself will give you a sign : Behold , a young woman is with child and will bear a son , and name him " Immanuel , " which means , " G'd is with us . " He will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good . For , before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good , the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted ... Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics . Further , he the Hebrew word " almah , " ( young woman ) , as specifically , " virgin . " But , this is not a prophecy about the Messiah . It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later . It is not a prophecy about a virgin ( bethulah ) mother . In short , it not about Jesus . Matthew has made use of a verse out of context , and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary . It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner , a very general one , it can be made to fit Mary . Mary , virgin or not , was indeed a young woman with child . Of course , the fit is shady and has problems . Jesus , while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men , was never called by the name , Immanuel . If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus , it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy ... a second class prophecy . Not too convincing . Egypt : After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem , Matthew tells about a quick ( and elsewhere unmentioned ) excursion to Egypt , as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses . This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king , Herod . [ Mt 2.15 ] ... and remained there until the death of Herod . This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken : " Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son . " What the lord really said was this . [ Hosea 11.1 ] When Israel was a child , I loved him . And , out of Egypt I called my son . The more I called them ( my people ) , the more they went from me ; they kept sacrificing to the Ba'als , and kept burning incense to idols . Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle . But , it was indeed Israel that , once called out of Egypt , wanted to return . This is history . Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here . And , if we are to draw some kind of parallel here , we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd . Again , this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped . Rachel Weeps : While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt , Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him , and thus ordered the executions of all young male children . Matthew then writes , [ Mt 2.17- 18 ] By this , that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled : " A voice was heard in Ramah , wailing and loud lamentation - - Rachel weeping for her children ; she refused to be consoled , because they were no more . " The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15 , referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon ( of Assyria ) in 722 BCE . Rachel , the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel , Ephraim , and Manasseh , is said to weep for her descendants who are " no more . " It is metaphorical , of course , since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile . It is interesting to note that it was Leah , not Rachel , who was the ancestor of the Judeans ( the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were ) . If anyone should do weeping for her " children , " it is Leah . The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city , " on the way to Ephrath , ( Bethlehem ) . " As for Herod and his infanticide , it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred . One never knows , but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible , nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time . Herod was particularly unliked in his reign , and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded . This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel . Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt , it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic , yet artificial , approval of Jesus . It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote . The " children " the prophet speaks of are not dead , but exiled in the Assyrian Empire . G'd comforts the weeping Rachel , saying that the children will be returned - - he will gather them back together . Of course , this would not suit Matthew's purpose , as the children he speaks of are dead for good . Again , the " prophecy " Matthew sets up is not even that , and to anyone who bothers to check it out , is not too convincing . The Nazarene : We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy . After leaving Egypt , Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth , [ Mt 2.23 ] ... that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled , " He shall be called a Nazarene . " First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet ( s ) this time . Second , we have to ask who " He " is . There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene . Worse , there are no prophecies , period , mentioning a Nazarene . Still worse , there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all . In the book of Judges , an angel tells Samson's mother that she will , [ Judges 13.5 ] " ... conceive and bear a son . No razor shall tough his head , for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his birth . He will deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines . " This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus , or the messiah of G'd . But , it is the best that can be found . Obviously , Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies , in that he is simple making them up now . Bearing our Diseases : Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities . [ Mt 8.17 ] This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah , " He took our infirmities and bore our diseases . " As expected , the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context , and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme . We have , [ Is 53.4 ] Surely he , [ the suffering servant ] , has borne our sickness , and carried our pains . From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah , we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel , Jehovah's chosen servant and people . He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile , in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it . This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity - - an image of a chastised , yet cherished , Israel as the instrument of the nations ' salvation by G'd . The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline . They do not speak of a " servant " going around and healing people . Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations ( and individual Jews ) . Jesus , as we all know , did not take the diseases onto himself . The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come , but rather something that had already happened . While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell , he did not bear the illnesses he healed . So , while someone might want to say that , figuratively , Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement , he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect . Silent Messiah : Upon healing multitudes of commoners , it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet , presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers . [ Mt 12.15- 21 ] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah . " Behold my servant whom I have chosen , my beloved , with whom my soul is pleased . I will put my spirit on him , and he will announce justice to the Gentiles . He will not wrangle or cry aloud , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets . He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory , and the gentiles will hope in his name . " The Isaiah passage quoted reads , [ Is 42.1- 4 ] Behold my servant whom I uphold , my chosen , in whom my soul delights . I have put my spirit on him , and he will bring forth justice to the nations . We will not cry or lift up his voice , or make it heard in the street . He will not break a bruised reed , or quench a smoldering wick . He will faithfully bring forth justice . He will not fail ( burn dimly ) or be discouraged ( bruised ) until he has established justice in the earth . And the coastlands await his law . You see , Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage , because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus . Christians could never think of Jesus failing , never would the " light " of mankind burn dimly . But , the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done . When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people , but rather all will be the children of G'd . Also , the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic " ... the coastlands await his law . " to the Christologic , " the Gentiles will hope in his name . " While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah , the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of " believing in the name . " If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus , one has only to read the whole chapter , Isaiah 42 , and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant , " a people robbed and plundered ... " So , we see that when Matthew's attempt at " prophecy " is examined , it crumbles . Three Days and Three Nights : Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself . He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection . [ Mt 12.40 ] For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights , so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights . Before any further discussion can occur , it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days . As far as day names went , each was 24 hours long , lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm . What was referred to as a " day " was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm . Thus , according to our time scale , a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening , and lasted until 6pm saturday evening . This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays , instead of Sundays . ( It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week ! ) Thus , when days and nights are referred to together , 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of . Thus , Jesus says that he will be in the grave , or in hell , or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights . As the good book tells us , Jesus was crucified on the " ninth hour , " which is 3pm , Friday afternoon . He then was put into the grave sometime after that . Then , Jesus left the grave , " rose , " before dawn of what we call Sunday ( The dawn after the sabbath was over ) . What this means is that Jesus was , using our time for clarity , in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning . We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday , since the bible is not specific here . What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day , two nights , and possibly a couple of hours of one day . Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction . There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights - - even using modern time measurements . We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes , and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth . And no matter who made the prediction , it is more than unconvincing ... it is counter-convincing . Hearing & Understanding : Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables - - stories in which a deeper meaning could be found , if you were already one of the elect , those chosen to understand the message of Jesus . He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants . If the people cannot understand them , there is no need to bother with them , since they will not accept the " plain " message any better . Matthew says , [ Mt 13.14- 16 ] With them [ the audience ] indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says , " You will indeed hear but never understand ; and you will indeed see , but never perceive . Because this people's heart has grown dull , their ears are heavy of hearing , and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them , her with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn for me to heal them . " The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works , his call to the ministry . This is in 740 BCE , when Israel is flourishing , right before it falls under the authority of Assyria . Isaiah sees the good times ending , and also a vision from G'd , calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah . [ Is 6.9- 13 ] And G'd said , " Go , and say to this people , ` Hear and hear , but do not understand ; see and see , but do not perceive . ' Make the heart of this people fat , make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes , so they will not see with their eyes , or hear with their ears , and understand with their hearts , and turn and be healed . " Then Isaiah said , " How long , lord ? " And he said , " Until the cities lie waste without inhabitant , and houses without men , and the land is utterly desolate , and the G'ds take men far away , and forsaken places are many in the land . And though a tenth will remain in it , it will be burned again , like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled . " The holy seed is its stump . Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings , but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's ( and David's ) seed / lineage . If you read the rest of Isaiah , you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant , a light to the nations . ( Look at Isaiah 42.18- 25 , 48.20 , 49.3 ) We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse , to suit his own gospel needs . More than that , he has altered the words , to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories . And , as we see , Isaiah's verses are not prophecies , but rather commands from G'd to him , in the present . Once again , Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face . Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval . [ Mt 13.35 ] ... he said nothing to them without a parable . This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet , " I will open my mouth to them in parables . I will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world . " Matthew really botches up here . He attempts to quote not from a prophet , but from the Psalms . [ Ps 78.2- 4 ] I will open my mouth in parable . I will utter dark sayings of old , things that we all have heard and known , things that our fathers have told us . We will not hide them from their children , but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord ... As was pointed out , the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet . You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet . Apparently , later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up . Perhaps the most significant part of this is that , once again , Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures . As Jesus has said earlier , he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them . The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden . Further , they speak of things " known , that our fathers have told us . " Jesus deals with things " hidden since the foundation of the world . " Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion . This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms . No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them ! And still once again , Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face . But , Christians rarely look at this . Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad . Excuses of Little Faith : In Mt . 17.14- 21 , we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons , except in one case . Not knowing what epilepsy was , the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons . It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to " dispossess " the epileptic . But , Jesus , perhaps no more enlightened than they , is reported to have rebuked them , saying they didn't have enough faith . This seems strange . Why was this demon special ? It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not . Apparently , enough faith will allow someone to move mountains . Of course , you will find no one , these days that can move real mountains . No one parts seas . The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place . Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T . V . And the gods , including Jesus , are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings , protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts . They are either dead , sleeping , or hiding in heaven , with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone . Yet , life goes on . Tales of mystics , stories of miracles - - all in a distant time or a distant place . Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days , Jehovah too . But , now they are silent . All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore . We're too lazy ; we're not zealous enough ; we're sinful ; it's just his " plan " ; we put too many of our own demands on G'd's appearance ; if we had the right faith , if we were willing to meet G'd on his terms ... Yet , even the most pious of men have not seen G'd . You , dear reader , have not seen G'd . Not literally , you know that to be true . ( I know that's presumptuous and bold . But , searching your heart , you know what I mean . ) All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd . They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd . Sometimes , they say , " See the love in these people you worship with ... see the lives of people change ... that is seeing G'd . " Thus people get lulled to sleep , satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights . But , that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of ... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see . What we see in the world that is good , is the compassion of human hearts , the love given and taken by men and women , the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike , beauty created by the mind of man . These are the things that are done ; these are what we see . But , it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith . Jesus Rides on an Ass : Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king , Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem . [ Mt 21.5 ] This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet , saying , Tell the daughter of Zion , " Behold , your king is coming to you , humble , mounted on an ass , and on a ass-colt . " Of course , the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently . Lo , your king comes to you ; he is triumphant and victorious , humble , and riding on an ass , on an ass - colt ... he will command peace to the nations . There isn't all that much difference here , except that Zechariah only involves one animal - - an ass-colt - - while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently . Thus , he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass . From Matthew's version , we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys . This could inevitably lead to a theological , proctological dilemma ! We find that in the account written earlier by St . Mark , only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus . This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly , and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses , he has bungled . Now , excluding many respectable Christians I have met , I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses , the situation is often reversed nowadays ... Then , entering the Jerusalem temple , the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah . But , Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done , [ Mt 21.16 ] Haven't you read ? ` Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise . ' It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little " prophetic " things AND since , as we might expect , the quote is in error , which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well . We might ask Jesus or Matthew , " Haven't you read ? " for the source reads , [ Psalms 8.1- 2 ] O YaHWeH our lord , how majestic is your name in the whole world ! You , whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants , you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger . The passages hardly need comment . There is no " perfect praise " spoken of in the psalm , and what praise is there is given to G'd , not his messiah king , and not Jesus . As mentioned , it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture . YHVH said to my lord ... : Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended . The Jews agree - - it is king David . But , then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110 , " The LORD said to my Lord , sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet . " Taken at face value , Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent . One assumes he is in opposition to their answer . Of course , the Christian answer is that he agrees , but is trying to make some hidden point , to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king . It's tempting to believe this , if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation . But , there are problems . In Jesus's time , the psalm was thought to be about the messiah . And , it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior . We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king , bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule . Of course , the Jews listening had no good answer , and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah , such as the Christians worship . The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm , an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made . One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews , often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king . Jesus was apparently one of these adventists , like his audience , who thought the messiah's advent was imminent , and who interpreted Psalms 110 , among others , as being messianic . What is the problem , then ? Psalm 110 literally reads , YHVH's utterance to my lord : " Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool . " YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion . Rule in the midst of your foes ! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains . " You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek forever . " The word " lord " is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord . But , in the Hebrew , the word is " adoni , " and no capitalisation exists . Adoni simply means " lord , " a generic term as we would use it . It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd . It is merely an address of respect . There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king . That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain . The title of the psalm translates to either " a psalm of David , " or " a psalm about David . " It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet , about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd . If the psalm had been written by David , it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah . The idea of a perfect king , descended from David , was not present in David's age . We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings - - none of which include any praises of a messiah . Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead , in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold . The description in the psalm fit David very well . David was promised by G'd a rise to power , victory over his enemies , successful judgement among the nations he conquered . He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king , enabled to bless the people . It all fits . We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone , though . Here , there is not artificial prophecy alluded to , though his use of the scripture is rather questionable . Still , this event is common to the other gospels too . So , we let Matthew off a little more easily this time . It is interesting to note , though , how Matthew dresses up the event . The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd . Matthew has the Pharisees , who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity , be the target of Jesus's question . As we might expect , Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees . Such power is the pen . Moses & Jesus , Had it Together All Along ... : We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel . The gospel story of John deserves special treatment , because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew . But , for the moment , we will just look at one verse . The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king , and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd . When constructing the history of Abraham , Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people . While this was accomplished eventually , under the rule of king David , the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise . But , to do so , they expanded on the promise , preaching about a heavenly kingdom . [ John 8.56 ] ( J . C . speaking ) Your father , Abraham , rejoiced to see My day . He say it and was glad . It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham , but , Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah , or anything Christian . I have tried , and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy . It is par for the course to see St . John making up Old Testament backings , just like his forerunner Matthew . Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud , and it is surprising they still cling to it . The Potter's Field : We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers , Judas Iscariot . Matthew writes , [ Mt 27.5- 10 ] And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple , [ Judas ] departed ... But , the chief priests , taking the silver , said , " It isn't lawful for us to put it in the treasury , since it is blood money . " So they ... bought a potter's field with it to bury strangers in ... Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah , " And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel , and they gave them for the potter's field , as the lord directed me . " This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture . First , Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet . It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of . [ Zech . 11.12- 13 ] ... And they weighed out my wages , thirty shekels of silver . Then YHVH said to me , " Cast them to the treasury , " - - the lordly price at which I was paid off by them . So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of YHVH . First of all , the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah , or of G'd . The deal with a shepherd , most likely a priest , chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another . The word , " treasury , " had been replaced by the King James Scholars with " to the potter , " precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better . But , this is a blatant error . The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed " treasury , " which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context , whereas " potter's field " is totally unrelated . Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation . However , given Matthew's track record , one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty . Of course , Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text . The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation , and if as most Christians seem to be , the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity , Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around . However , the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests . The high priests would not put the money in the treasury . The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite ! Of course , to the average Thursday-Night Bible student , the " prophecy " as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value . To those , Matthew's work is convincing enough . Wine , Vinegar , & Casting Lots : Then , Jesus is led away to be crucified . [ Mt 27.34- 35 ] ... they gave him vinegar to drink , mingled with gall ; but when he tasted it , he would not drink it . And , when they had crucified him , they divided his garments among them by casting lots : that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet , " They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots . " First of all , the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine , of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly . We find that right before Jesus dies , the soldiers themselves give him some to drink - - not polluted with gall . [ Jn 19.28- 30 ] Jesus ... said , " I thirst . " A bowl of vinegar stood there , so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth . When he had received the vinegar , he said , " It is finished ; " But , Matthew seems to be drawing on , not a passage from the prophets , but one from the Psalms . [ Ps 69.20- 28 ] I looked for pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none . They gave me poison for food ( lit . they put gall in my meat ) , and for my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink ... Add to them punishment upon punishment , may they have no acquittal from thee . Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Living . Of course , the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink . This does indeed seem to be a show of pity . The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies . It is not about the messiah or Jesus . It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the " Jesus " in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the " crucifiers , " whereas the Jesus of the gospels says , [ Lk 23.34 ] Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , the don't know what they do ! " Further , Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall ( a bitter substance ) put into Jesus's drink , not his meat , as the psalm stipulates . With the " prophecy " of the vinegar faulty , we naturally ask , " What of the casting of lots ? " This brings up the 22nd Psalm , which deserves discussion all by itself . Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing . It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days . As we will soon see , it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus . It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes . For a man so removed from worldly possessions , his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions . The 22nd Psalm : This psalm is attributed to David , as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies . It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope . Taken out of context , parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well . We will examine the primary passages . Verse 1-2 : My god , my god ! why have you forsaken me ? ! Why are you so far from helping me , far from the words of my groaning ? Oh , my god , I cry by day , but you don't answer , and by night , but find no rest . Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross . This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus , rather than king David . Of course , the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution . Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal , he is supposed to be like " the lamb led mute before its shearers . " Indeed , Jesus doesn't do much groaning , even when on the cross . He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross . 6-8 : But , I am a worm , and no man - - scorned by men ... All who see me mock at me . They make faces and wag their heads ; " He committed his cause to YHVH . So let him deliver him ... for he delights in him . " This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well , with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm . 12-13 : Many bulls encompass me ... they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion . 16-18 : Yea , dogs are round about me , a company of evildoers encir-cle me , they have pierced my hands and feet . I can see all my bones ... They divide my garments among them , and cast lost for my raiment . 19-21 : But you , YHVH , be not far away ! ... Deliver my soul from the sword , my life from the power of the dog ! Save me from the mouth of the lion , and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull ! It would seem quite convincing , and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too . Unfortunately , this prophecy has a fatal flaw . The words " have pierced " really do not exist in the psalm . The correct Hebrew translation is , 16 : Yea , dogs are round about me , a company of evildoers encircles me , like the lion , they are at my hands and feet ... In Hebrew the phrase " like the lion " and a very rare verb form which can mean " pierced " differ by one phonetic character . The word in the Hebrew text is literally , " like the lion " ( ka'ari ) , which makes sense in the context , and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer . It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to " ka'aru . " But , to add the needed ( yet artificial ) weight to the " prophecy " this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do . While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus , its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators . Apart from the erroneous verse 16 , the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily . Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross . This naturally fits the psalm's true subject , king David . As a side note , we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands , the palms , but rather the forearms . This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms . But then , facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs . Matthew escapes culpability this time , as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus . But the psalm , like many others , was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death . How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology . It is easy to see , for those who are not faithful fundamentalists , how some of the events in the New Testament might have been " enhanced " by scribes such as the eager Matthew . But , it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims . So far , this has not said good things for St . Matthew . The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion . John's gospel recount , written about 70 years after the fact , tells us at Jesus's execution , [ Jn 19.34 , 37 ] But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and out came blood and water ... these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled ... " The will look on him whom they've pierced . " Of course , this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context . Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them . [ Zc 12.7- 10 ] And YHVH will give victory to Judah ... And on that day , I will seek to destroy the nations that come against Jerusalem ( in Judah ) . And I will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication ... on Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced , they will mourn , and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child . John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts . Matthew , at least , usually excontexts more than just one passage . John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here . It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers , as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded . Reckoned with Transgressors : After his arrest , Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship , messiahship . According to one version of the gospel tale , Jesus gets executed along with two thieves . [ Mk 15.27 ] And with him they crucified two robbers , one on his right , one on his left . And so the scripture was fulfilled which says , " He was reckoned with the transgressors . " Here , Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53 , about the servant nation of Israel . The passage is not about the messiah , for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53 , and its surrounding chapters , one sees that the servant is a nation . The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past , not a prediction of what is to come , in any event . The servant is thought of as a criminal . This also happens to fit the description of Jesus . Had the passage really been about the messiah , it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the " prophecy " in Isaiah . Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry . He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career . Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy , at least in this case , as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons . Mark goes on to tell us how " those who were crucified with [ Jesus ] also reviled him . " [ 15.32 ] This is to be expected from a couple of robbers . Of course in his later recount , St . Luke decides to change some things . Luke tells us , [ Lk 23.39- 43 ] And one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed , " Aren't you the messiah ? ! Save yourself , and us ! " This certainly fits with Mark's recount , which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said , " Save yourself ! " and that the robbers did the same . But then Luke goes on , But the other [ criminal ] rebuked [ the first ] saying , " Don't you fear G'd , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ? And we , indeed justly so , for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds . But , this man has done nothing wrong . And he said , " Jesus , remember me when you come in your kingdom . " And Jesus answered , " Verily I say to you , today you will be with me in paradise . " Now , this little dialogue seems highly contrived . It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech . We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering . Such a man , apparently noble and of principle , doesn't seem likely to have been a robber . We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke . Of course , Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's . Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus , not both . It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up , but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open . This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology . In this case , the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems , as we have seen . The End of the World - - Mt . 24 : Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament . It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories , and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity . Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings , and his disciples ask him about this , and about the end of the world which he has been warning about . The disciples : Tell us , when will this [ the temple's destruction ] be , and what will be the sign of your coming , and of the close of the age ? Jesus : Take care that no one leads you astray , for many will come in my name , saying , " I am the christ . " ... you will hear of wars and rumours of wars ... for this must take place , but the end is not yet . For , nation will rise against nation ... all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs . They will deliver you up ... put you to death , and false prophets will arise and lead many astray .
   ... But he who endures to the end will be saved . This gospel will be preached throughout the whole world , a testimony to the nations , and then the end will come . So , when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel , ... let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . Immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun will be darkened ... the stars will fall from heaven ... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven , and all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and see the Son of Man coming ... and he will send out his angels ... and gather his elect ... Learn the lesson of the fig tree : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves , you know that summer is near . So also , when you see all these things , you will know that He is near , at the very gate . Truly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place ... But , of the day and hour , no one knows ; not the angels , not the Son , but only the Father ... Therefore , you also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect . From this , it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples . He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour , that it will come , and thus they must be ready . Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error . But , unfortunately , Jesus made himself to explicit . He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End , and that they in particular should prepare for it , prepare to be swept away . There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible , and said that the phrase , " this generation shall not pass away ... " really means " this race of people will not pass away ... " Of course , the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that , the generation of the disciples . It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek , he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear . But . it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples ( at least some of them ) are supposed to live to the End of the World . The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles ' responses . It becomes abundantly clear from Rev . 22.7 , 1 Peter 4.7 , 1 John 2.18 , and Rev . 22.20 , that Jesus meant exactly what he said . The End was very near . For 2,000 years , Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew , or ignored its meaning altogether . For 2,000 years , they have waited for their executed leader to come back , hearing of wars , and rumours of wars , sure that He is coming soon . Surely He must be . All we must do is wait . Can you imagine how tired He must be , sitting around up there , being holy , waiting for just the right moment to spring ? So , shortly after his crucifixion , Jesus of Nazareth , ( Joshua-ben-Joseph ) , died . It is said that after three days , or three days and three nights , or three periods of time , or three eternal seconds - - or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble - - he was seen again , resurrected , glowing with divine radiance . Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around , and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven . So the story goes , anyway . As has been seen , there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down . To them , Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture . We have seen , though , that this matter is quite shaky . But , throughout Church history , Christians have held fast to faith , in simple belief . What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force , faith and forgetfulness kept away from question . To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters . Thus for 2,000 years , the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted . Things may well continue that way for some time . Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used ( properly or improperly ) to support wars and persecution , I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold . [ Mt 10.34 ] Jesus : " Don't think that I have come to bring peace on earth . I haven't come to bring peace , but rather a sword .

What else but reason I can use ? I don't have the spiritual means Christians often refer to . My conscience disagrees with the Bible . I don't even believe I have a soul . I am fully dependent on my body - indeed , I _am_ this body . When it goes up with flames , so does my identity . God can entertain herself with copies of me if she wants . : To learn you must accept that which you don't know . What does this mean ? To learn you must accept that you don't know something , right-o . But to learn you must _accept_ something I don't know , why ? This is not the way I prefer to learn . It is unwise to merely swallow everything you read . Suppose I write a book telling how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn ( tm ) has helped me in my daily problems , would you accept this , since you can't know whether it is true or not ? Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent , omnipresent , and loves just about everyone . Besides , He ( and She ) is guiding every writer on this planet , you and me , and not just some people who write legendary stories 2000 years ago .

It hasn't be proved , nor has it been disproved . No one has a proof one way or the other , but many people are interested in it ! I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the existence of God one way or the other . The two possibilities are supernaturalism and naturalism . Of course no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with supernaturalism , but similarly , no set of circumstances can be inconsistent with naturalism . In naturalism , any phenomenon that could be described as God is considered part of the natural world , to be studied as any other natural phenomenon ( gravity , for instance ) . For example , if a loud ` ` godlike ' ' voice vociferously announced , ` ` I am God , I exist , and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity , ' ' and if then gravity did indeed reverse , a naturalist ( probably a scientist ) would say , ` ` Boy , we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we thought we did , and that loud voice is something new .

If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity , and have nothing to say about behaviour , then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion . But once you start talking about behaviour , then someone's suscept - ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are - I assume - worried about . And in that area , what you care about is whether someone is sceptical , critical and autonomous on the one hand , or gullible , excitable and easily led on the other . I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led . Whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point . jon .From : frank@D012S658.uucp ( Frank O'Dwyer ) Subject : Re : After 2000 years , can we say that Christian Morality is In article <1993Apr15.125245.12872@abo.fi> MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI ( Mats Andtbacka ) writes : | In <1qie61$fkt@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp writes : | > In article <3 0114@ursa.bear.com > halat@pooh.bears ( Jim Halat ) writes : | | > #I'm one of those people who does not know what the word objective means | > #when put next to the word morality .

Cute characterization Bill ; however , there is no inconsistency between the two statements . Even if one believes that religion is " primitive , simple-minded and unscientific , anti-intellectual and childish " , one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation .

I read his " Satanic Bible " a few years ago for a social studies project , as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called " The Cult of Devil Worship in America . " The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self . When I refer to Satanism , I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan . I don't consider LaVey's church to be at all " orthodox , " nor do I consider its followers " satanists . " LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche , Crowley , and Reich , slapped in some religious doctrine , added a little touch of P . T . Barnum , and christened his creation the Church of Satan . No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention ... I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex . At any rate , it worked ( for a while ) . In its heyday , the Church had a huge following , including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis , Jr . and Jayne Mansfield . ( I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy , by the way . ) I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ . But if you include the Church of Satan , then I suppose I need to alter my definition .

This person instead has posted one of the worst arguments I have ever seen made from the pro-Christian people . I've known several Jesuits who would laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them . Let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment ( nice word Maddi , original or is it a real word ? ) and concentrate on the liar , lunatic part . The argument claims that no one would follow a liar , let alone thousands of people . Look at L . Ron Hubbard . Now , he was probably not all there , but I think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist . But look at how many thousands of people follow Dianetics and Scientology . I think the Baker's and Swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all the time , but look at the number of follower they have . As for lunatics , the best example is Hitler . He was obviously insane , his advisors certainly thought so . Yet he had a whole country entralled and came close to ruling all of Europe . How many Germans gave their lives for him ?

At first , the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using , not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets . But later , and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit , they changed their tone . It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war , that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare . It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was " nice and clean " ( smart missiles dropping in on military HQs ) , but not when pictures of dead , dying , and maimed civilians started cropping up .

I have often wondered about this . I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk . A good , inpenatrable military target . The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be . But I digress . Yes , I have heard that we found evidence ( after the war , BTW ) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb . Unfortunately , the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum . Therefore the second bomb was dropped . Most unfortunate , IMO . > > > I , for one , don't regret it . > > Nuke a Jap for Jesus ! > I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people .

Actually , it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action . If some back-water country took over some other back-water country , we probably wouldn't intervene . Not that we don't care , but we can't be the world's policman . Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait ( instead of an invasion ) , then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia . But the combination of the two , an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil interests , caused us to take action . > > [ I've moved a paragraph from here to later on ] > [ ... ] > > > > If we hadn't intervened , allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait , then it would > > have been appeasement . > > Right .

I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering . I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say . That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved . And perhaps it * was * unnecessary as ( let's say ) we now know . That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary . Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision . At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it . But don't assume that I feel the bombing was * morally * justified - - I don't !

Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial / military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time . But in the Gulf War , precision bombing was the norm . So the point was , why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted * in spite of * precision bombing , when so many more civilians ( proportionately and quantitatively ) died under the blanket bombing in WW2 ? Even with precision bombing , mistakes happen and some civilians suffer . But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history ! Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids . The stories of " hundreds of thousands " of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . Yes , bunk . The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! But we are expected to swallow that " hundreds of thousands " of * civilian * Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months ! And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that ! What hogwash . If " hundreds of thousands " of Iraqi civilians died , it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people , not due to the Allied bombing .

In a sense , HG is necessarily more " complicated " than H for any H and G , so I may be splitting hairs , but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is , P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) holds , with equality if and only if P ( HG ' ) = 0 . > As you point out , it's a very simple matter to show P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) > = = > P ( H | x ) > P ( HG | x ) , and thus H is to be preferd to HG . Now to say > that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) . > Can you elaborate some on this . Well , " P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) " means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative . This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative ; the difference reduces to the difference between the ( unknown and unhelpful ) prior probabilities P ( A ) and P ( B ): P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) = = > P ( A | x ) = k P ( A ) , and P ( B | x ) = k P ( B ) where k = P ( x | A ) / P ( x ) = P ( x | B ) / P ( x ) . So A and B are " equally consistent with the data " in that observing x doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative . In the particular case where A = H and B = HG , however , we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) , although we don't know the actual values , and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG . > Also , in the " real world " it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems > to me . We can't always determine whether the equality " P ( x | H ) = > P ( x | HG ) " is true . That's certainly true , but the particular point here was whether or not a ` divine component ' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component , which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of ` spreading the word ' . Now it seems to me , as I've said , that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model , but rather * less * well if one proposes a ` divine component ' in addition , since I would expect the latter to conspire * against * wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs . Thus my * personal * feeling is that P ( x | HG ) isn't even equal to P ( x | H ) in this case , but is smaller ( H is memetic transmission , G is ` divine component ' , x is the variance among beliefs ) . But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression . > BTW , my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one - > I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very > careful so there probably isn't a " math mistake " .

I'm not a Baysian statistician ( nor any type of > statistician ) , so this would be very helpful . Not that I'm a statistician as such either , but : The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the ( read ` my ' ) observations to date . However , theism ( of the type with which I am concerned ) * also * suggests that , for instance , prayer may be answered , people may be miraculously healed ( both are in principle amenable to statistical verification ) and that god / s may generally intervene in measurable ways . This means that these regions of the space of possible observations , which I loosely termed " appearances of god / s " , have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic . Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space , the probability which theism expends on making " appearances of god / s " possible must come from somewhere else ( i . e . other possible observations ) . All else being equal , this means that an observation which * isn't * an " appearance of god / s " must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism . The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase , with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis . Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque , but it's rather difficult to put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities , and particularly that the total area under them is always unity . An analogy may ( or may not :-) be helpful . Say that hypothesis A is " the coin is fair " , and that B is " the coin is unfair ( two-headed ) " . ( I've used A and B to avoid confusion with H [ heads ] and T [ tails ] . ) Then P ( H | A ) = 0.5 } total 1 P ( T | A ) = 0.5 } P ( H | B ) = 1 } total 1 P ( T | B ) = 0 } The observations are a string of heads , with no tails . This is compatible with both a fair coin ( A ) and a two-headed coin ( B ) . However , the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails ( even though they don't actually appear ) must come from somewhere else , since the total must be unity , and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads . Say our running estimates at time n - 1 are e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) and e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) . The observation x [ n ] at time n is another head , x [ n ] = H . The estimates are modified according to P ( H | A ) e [ n ] ( A ) = e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) * - - - = e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) * m P ( H ) and P ( H | B ) e [ n ] ( B ) = e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) * - - - = e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) * 2m P ( H ) Now we don't know P ( H ) , the * actual * prior probability of a head , but the multiplier for e ( A ) is half that for e ( B ) . This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed . Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates , after n heads , we have n e [ n ] ( A ) = m e [ 0 ] ( A ) and n e [ n ] ( B ) = ( 2m ) e [ 0 ] ( B ) , and since e [ k ] ( A ) + e [ k ] ( B ) = 1 at any time k , you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2 . Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads . The loose analogy is between " unfair coin " and atheism , and between " fair coin " and theism , with observations consistent with both . A tail , which would falsify " unfair coin " , is analogous to an " appearance of god / s " , which would falsify atheism . I am * not * claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities , just that the principle is the same . > > Constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them > ^ ^ ^ > > is at all possible under the respective theisms , constantly increases > ^ ^ ^ > > the notional estimated probability that they don't exist , > It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could > be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't . > Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible , > it doesn't make sense to say " lack of evidence " supports the contrary > view .

We don't need , in the above analogy , to know * any * prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity , and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity . You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates either . It's clear that after a large number of observations , P ( fair-coin ) approaches zero and P ( two-headed-coin ) approaches unity . All you need to know is whether P ( x | Ha ) is larger than P ( x | Ht ) for observed x , and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered * possible * ( not necessary ) under Ht which are not possible under Ha , and all else is equal . > Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations .

I'll explain , but bear in mind that this isn't central ; all I require of a theism is that it * not * make the prediction " Appearances of god / s will never happen " , as does atheism . ( Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn't make this prediction either , the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition . ) Predictions include such statements as " Prayer is efficacious " ( implying " If you do the stats , you will find that Prayer is efficacious " ) , or " Prayer is * not * efficacious " , or " Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .

Right on , Jon ! Who cares who or whose , as long as it works for the individual . But don't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children .

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people . That is it's primary ( and I would argue only ) purpose . To continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility , especially when you know you will be killing innocents , is unconscionable . At the very least , the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society , not their detriments . We are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems . One has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment . Just in case I wasn't clear again : We maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain . Why ?

Well , this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt.atheism , where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system , without resorting to accusing others of bigotry . It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting , since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity . I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race , religion , ethnic background , sex , or other inconsequential characteristics . All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics . Thus , pending further evidence , I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots , and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

The deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with > the demonstrations , or on the demonstrators themselves , if they were > violent . To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour > against Rushdie ? Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media , the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations . For every twenty or so newspaper , magazine articles , interviews etc . supporting Rushdie , there would appear one Muslim voice . This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was , not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time . This approx . twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis , with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment , the valiant defender of everyman's right to free speech decoupled from responsibility . ( As an aside , it's interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up , some books ( defaming certain ethnic and religious groups ) continued to be banned here . It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups . For Muslims this kind of double standard was annoying . ) Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at " organized " Islam , and he did so with admirable verbal skill . The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a " secular " Islam - an Islam separated from it's Qur'an , it's Prophet , God , its legislation , and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena . Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known . The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was , by this time , already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals . The situation was a serious one , with far-reaching political implications . At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie , throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution . Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility , has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind , has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down . Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in " boldly " defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work , no matter what insult they find within it . Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular " heroic Knight " , mounted on the his media steed , doing battle with the " dragon " of Islamic " fundamentalism " . Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a Muslim atmosphere , knew well what Muslim's hold dear , who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander , insult , and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who , when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis , continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who , even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation , continued his mischief , instead of having the good sense to desist . Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale , mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged . The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief even after this , was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief . The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support , government support was just that - support . The source was Rushdie ( and his publishers , who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media ) . The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making , was applied to Rushdie . > You're attempts at justification are not doing the > image of Islam any good . I have made no attempts at justification , only at explanation . " Image " is the chief concern of Muslim ' apologists ' for Islam and for Rushdie . If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture , such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good " image " ( Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image ) . A " good image " usually means " be more like me " .

The two statements following ARE consistent : ( 1 ) I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks ( 2 ) I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks The two statements following are NOT consistent : ( 3 ) I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks ( 4 ) I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks Statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) require no faith , they make no presumptions about the nature of reality . Statements ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) require belief . Many atheists ( myself included ) take the following position : ( 5 ) I do not believe that there is a god . ( 6 ) I do not believe that there is not a god . That is , I harbor no beliefs at all , there is no good evidence for god existing or not . Some folks call this agnosticism .

" | The Tear GardenFrom : mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu ( MTA ) Subject : Atheism survey I am doing research on atheism , part of which involves field research here on the net . The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief . I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu . First of all , I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail ; it's possible to give succinct answers to most everything , but there's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours , I'm sure . As much detail as you want to give me ( I mean it ) is great , but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible , so even minimal responses are far better than nothing - - it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration . Secondly , I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious ; I know that phrases like " What would convince you of the existence of God " imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens . In fact , I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself , so my use of " God " is a question of locution rather than ideology - - it's easier than just repeating " a deity or higher power " every time . Also , I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like " belief system " although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs , but are skeptical towards everything . I understand ; but you know what I mean . Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across . Lastly , thanks ! Please fill out as much as you can , in as much detail as you can , and send them to me . My research and I thank you . - - - Where would you place your beliefs , on the spectrum Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism ? Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs . In what , if any , religious tradition were you raised ? Did you ever believe in the existence of a God ? ( Several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is " yes ; " if you've always been an atheist , or at least never a theist , you may have to modify the question / answer somewhat . ) How serious was your / your family's involvement ? How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe ? How and when did your " final break " with your beliefs , if any , occur ? I realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an " event " per se ; whatever the case , just describe it in whatever detail you wish . What contact with other atheists have you had ; before and after ( and during ) your " conversion " to atheism ? ( Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts - - how have net discussions affected your beliefs ? ) To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs ? Did you come by your beliefs through discussion , through independent means , or by some combination of the two or other means ? Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means ( proofs of the non-existence of God , etc ) , or was it perhaps , at least in part , through other means ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc ) ? To what extent do you feel you " understand " the universe through your beliefs ? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence ( anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs ) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where are they lacking as an explanatory method ? What would it take for you to question , or change , your beliefs ? What would convince you of the existence of God , what would convince you of the plausibility of God's existence , and so forth ? How dynamic are your beliefs - - are they constantly changing ; have they stayed more or less the same for some time ? Are you involved in a career or education in science ? To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs ? ( Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new " secular religion , " and that " scientists are , in a very real sense , the new priesthood . " Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi - religious base , or even a religious element ? ) - - - This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals , but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me . Would you be willing to have me , on the basis of this survey , write you to find out more about you and your beliefs ? If not , fine ; your filling out the survey alone is great . - - - Thanks again . Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what I'm doing with this data , or if you have anything to say in addition to what I've asked about above . Mark Abbott mtabbott@unix.amherst.edFrom : acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu Subject : Idle questions for fellow atheists I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population . It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways , I know , but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit , so I figure I might as well post something new myself . Also , how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from the other , qualitatively . But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere , and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core , than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ; ie , how it expresses its own selfishness .

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic . But to do so is absolutely useless now . If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture , you could have , but you chose to wait . Now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation . " But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . " - Matthew 24:13 II . REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ's second coming . Also know as " the time of Jacob's ( Israel's ) trouble " ( Jere 30:7 ) and " Daniel's Seventieth Week " ( Dan 9 ) , this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror . III . GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community ( the revived Roman Empire ) , Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason . The Bible , however , will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation . IV . READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated , even if you are careful , it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them . It is especially important to read Daniel , Luke 21 , Matthew 24 , Revelation , and Amos , for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you . V . PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray and pray . Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ . VI . DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community , he will institute a world economic system , designed so that you cannot buy , sell , or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name . Money will be useless . " And he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads , and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . Here is wisdom . Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man : His number is 666 " - Revelation 13:16- 18 . The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity . Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past , such as the Holocaust . [ or maybe the crusades ? - M ] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's rule ; it will be much worse than anything in history ( Matt 24:21 ) " ... I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held . And a white robe was given to each of them : and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer , until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren , who would be killed as they were , was completed . " Revelation 6:9 , 11 . His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn / " ... And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands . " - Revelation 20:4 . He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ . Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you , even your children , torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark . If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image , however , you will be consigned to the second death , which is the Lake of Fire . [ Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash ... - M ] You cannot be redeemed . It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [ sic ] to endure eternal torment in the Ring ^ H ^ H ^ H ^ H Lake of Fire . " ... If anyone worships the Beast and his image , and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand , he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation . An [ sic ] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb . " - Revelation 14:9- 10 [ and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders ; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium - - M ] VII . SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government until the end of the Tribulation , all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening , since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake . The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area , for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas . Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation . [ " As you can see on the weather map , heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak . Expect delays on I - 95 outbound , and perhaps school closings " - - M ] Store water and food , because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark . Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood . [ Get a good water filter . - - M ] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons , as well as flashlights , batteries , generators , and First Aid supplies . In short , learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did . VIII . TRUST NO ONE There will be secret agents everywhere , spying for the Antichrist's government . Be on the lookout . [ Perot supporters take note - - M ] IX . WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to , for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it . We can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man . Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation , he will dominate the airwaves . He will be physically appealing , highly intelligent , with Christ-like charisma and personality . An international politician , military tactician and economic expert , his word will be peace ; he will make a treaty with the Jews , which he will break after three and a half years . He will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed . Even the very elect will be deceived . If you do not pray and read the Bible , you too will be deceived . [ Dominate the airwaves ? Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh ... - M ] The antichrist will have a companion , the False Prohphet [ sic ] , who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak . All who refuse to worhsip [ sic ] the image will be killed . The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane , with demonized spirits everywhere . X . DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE ! The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ . The Antichrist will be defeated . Be steadfast and endure , and you will be rewarded greatly in Heaven . Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now . The salvation of your sould depends upon it . Determine that , come what may , you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist . You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved , but this time you will have to be " faithful unto death .

I haven't read Lewis's article , so I can't comment directly upon it , and have only spoken about his writings _in general _ so far , that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam . His anti-Islamic polemics , as I understand it , are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths . Again , read " Orientalism " by Edward Said . I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust , in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book ( it is a well-known book ) and check the evidence out for _yourself_ . > The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES , > when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex . > I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines , I wrote an > incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not > want his concubine to get pregnant etc . , which is contrary > to the notion that " sex is for procreation only " .

I understand your point of view , Selim - - I think , rather , it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ . Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before . Regarding women , I have made posting after posting on this subject , showing that Islam is not anti-woman , etc . However , have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them ? I just reposted a very good one , under the title " Islam and Women " , reposted from soc.religion.islam . If this has already disappeared from your site , then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article . IMHO , your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient . Regarding slaves , _my_ posting on slavery - - the second one I made , which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year - - is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view . Our approaches are different - - you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths . Now , just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action , does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam , even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah ? No ! Of course not . Let me give you a concrete example , which might help clarify this for you . The Qur'an prohibits drinking . Now , if a person says " I am a Muslim " and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer , does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer ? Of course not , and only an idiot would think so . Do you see my point ? > It is very natural to think that > the author / authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic > structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm > shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of > the feudal era and the rise of commerce , second with the industrial > revolution .

In fact , the rise of Islam can easily be modeled > after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home , > but increase your wealth by conquering places . You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms . Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth - - this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings . To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking - - Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist . ( This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market - - for it does in general - - but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it . ) > When this stopped , > you ( and I ) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour . > No capital , no industry , very poor social services - the education > level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world , the health > statistics are miserable etc .. One can postulate numerous reasons for this . Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist , etc . etc . Selim , I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think ( as you obviously do ) that Islam = > lack of education and power . For a large part of history , the Islamic world was very powerful . For a significant section of history , the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences . So to say that Islam is , for example , anti-education is completely absurd . You try to blame this situation on Islam - - history shows that your conclusion is false and that , instead , there must be other reasons for this situation . > You blame Muslims for not following the Quran , but I blame Muslims > for following the Quran . Well , Selim , your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam . I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not . > Your idea is baseless from historical > facts , it is a poor utopia , The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage - - yet somehow , in your theory , it is by " following the Qur'an " that Muslims are backwards in education . Selim , it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical , for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory . > while my ideas are derived from social > and economic history . You have certainly not shown this ; you have merely stated it . So far , it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history . That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this . > My solution to all Muslims is simple : > CUT THE CRAP , I think , Selim , you should consider taking your own advice . > GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too . > AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE > THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE . Selim , you have such conviction of your viewpoint , yet you demonstrate ignorance , not only of Islam but also of Islamic history ( particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think ) . Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history ! Selim , if I remember right , you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam . I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues , and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have .

Thanks for a well put testimonial . Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice . The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right , but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up . Seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that scouting is still worth fighting for . On a cautionary note , you must realize that if your experience with this camp leader was in the BSA you may be putting him at risk by publicizing it . Word could leak out to the BSA gestapo .

But it rather depends on what the ' certain circumstances ' are . When you talk about Christianity , or Islam , then at least your claims can be understood .

However , who is at blame is another question .

So when you do > either , you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or > later result in the killing of an innocent person . Yes , but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity .

Okay , so this is what you call murder . But , the question is whether or not all such " murders " are wrong . Are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong , no matter what the circumstances ? > If we , as a society , decide to murder someone , then we should say > that , and lists our reasons for doing so , and live with the moral > consequences . We should not play word games and pretend that > murder isn't murder . And that's * my * opinion about how society > ought to be run . But , this is basically how it works . Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution . And , every member of society shares this blame .

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not .

Yes , while we could objectively determine the difference ( if we knew all possible information ) , we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system . I think that our system is almost as good as possible , but it still isn't objectively perfect . You see , it doesn't matter if we * know * it is fair or not .

A climatologist ( Ithink that was his profession ) named Iben Browning predicted that an earthquake would hit the New Madrid fault on Dec . 3 . Some schools in Missouri that were on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day . Many people evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are . I wouldn't be suprised if there were more journalists in the area than residents . Of course , teh earthquake never occured . HOw do I know about his ? I used to live in Southern Illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the fault line . No we still had school ...

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I've articulated it above _ ( which may not be the true view of Khomeini ) is from the basic principles of Islam . So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them . And if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam , how subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an . > The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the > esoteric teachings of the Prophet ( S .

I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur'an . However , _prima facie _ such attemptsa are highly susceptible to degenerating into monkery , explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an . > As salaam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam GreggFrom : edm@twisto.compaq.com ( Ed McCreary ) Subject : Re : Genocide is Caused by Theism : Evidence ? > > > On 25 Apr 93 23:26 : 20 GMT , bobbe @vice ( Robert Beauchaine ; 6086 ; 59-323 ; LP = A ; YAyG ) said : ... execellent examples of Luther's insane rantings deleted ...

The Bible is far from universally accepted . The Bible is NOT a proof of god ; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god . ( Or does it prove even that ? They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories . As in the case of Dionetics . ) Assuming the writers believed it , the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it . And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct . 2 ) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible . 3 ) Again , read the FAQ . > freedom .

McElwaine , Physicist Ninety to a hundred years ago , everybody " knew " that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly . It would violate the " laws " of physics . All of the " experts " and " authorities " said so . For example , Simon Newcomb declared in 1901 : " The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances , known forms of machinery and known forms of force , can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air , seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be . " Fortunately , a few SMART people such as the Wright Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final word . Now we take airplanes for granted , ( except when they crash ) . Today , orthodox physicists and other " scientists " are saying similar things against several kinds of ' Free Energy ' Technologies , using negative terms such as " pseudo-science " and " perpetual motion " , and citing so-called " laws " which assert that " energy cannot be created or destroyed " ( " 1st law of thermodynamics " ) and " there is always a decrease in useful energy " ( " 2nd law of thermodynamics " ) . The physicists do not know how to do certain things , so they ARROGANTLY declare that those things cannot be done . Such PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern " science " and help to cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox modern theories . Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe , with - OUT burning any kind of fuel , making them the PERFECT SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated pollution , degradation , and depletion of the environment . Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy , but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by various forms of induction . UNLIKE solar or wind devices , they need little or no energy storage capacity , because they can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed . Solar energy has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds , trees , buildings , or the earth itself , or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes . Likewise , wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and often non-existent . Neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes . Properly designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations . For example , at least three U . S . patents ( # 3,811 , 058 , # 3,879 , 622 , and # 4,151 , 431 ) have so far been awarded for motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS , seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic field . The first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running . The third one , as described in detail in " Science & Mechanics " magazine , Spring 1980 , ( " Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor " , by Jorma Hyypia , pages 45-48 , 114-117 , and front cover ) , requires critical sizes , shapes , orientations , and spacings of magnets , but NO feedback . Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one's home , YEAR ROUND , FOR FREE . [ Complete descriptive copies of U . S . patents are $ 3.00 each from the U . S . Patent Office , 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy . , Arlington , VA 22202 ; correct 7 - digit patent number required . Or try getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your local public or university library's inter-library loan dept .. ] A second type of free-energy device , such as the ' Gray Motor ' ( U . S . Patent # 3,890 , 548 ) , the ' Tesla Coil ' , and the motor of inventor Joseph Newman [ see SCIENCE , 2-10- 84 , pages 571-2 . ] , taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from ' EARTH RESONANCE ' ( about 12 cycles per second plus harmonics ) . They typically have a ' SPARK GAP ' in the circuit which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped . It is important that the total ' inductance ' and ' capacitance ' of the Device combine to ' RESONATE ' at the same frequency as ' EARTH RESONANCE ' in order to maximize the power output . This output can also be increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the ' NEUTRAL CENTER ' of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet . In the case of a Tesla Coil , slipping a ' TOROID CHOKE COIL ' around the secondary coil will enhance output power . [ " Earth Energy : Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems " , by John Bigelow , 1976 , Health Research , P . O . Box 70 , Mokelumne Hill , CA 95245 . ] During the 1930 ' s , an Austrian civil engineer named Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an ' IMPLOSION TURBINE ' ( German name , ' ZOKWENDLE ' ) , after analyzing erosion , and lack of erosion , in differently shaped waterways , and developing sophisticated mathematical equations to explain it . As described in the book " A Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources " , by Dan A . Davidson , 1977 , water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a CRITICAL VELOCITY . The water then IMPLODES , no longer touching the inside walls of the tubing , and drives the pump , which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC GENERATOR . The device seems to be tapping energy from that of the earth's rotation , via the ' Coriolis effect ' , LIKE A TORNADO . [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY ! ] A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the ' McClintock Air Motor ' ( U . S . Patent # 2,982 , 261 ) , which is a cross between a diesel engine ( it has three cylinders with a compression ratio of 27 to 1 ) and a rotary engine ( with solar and planetary gears ) . It burns NO FUEL , but becomes self-running by driving its own air compressor . This engine also generates a lot of heat , which could be used to heat buildings ; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large trucks , preventing their slowing down when climbing hills . [ David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the automatic transmission , differential , and 4 - wheel drive . ] Crystals may someday be used to supply energy , as shown in the Star Trek shows , perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector . One other energy source should be mentioned here , despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free Energy . A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION reactor which he calls ' Migma ' , which uses NON-radioactive deuterium as a fuel [ available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities from sea water ] , does NOT produce radioactive waste , can be converted DIRECTLY into electricity ( with-OUT energy-wasting steam turbines ) , and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city . And UNLIKE the " Tokamaks " and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about , Migma WORKS , already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in . [ " New Times " ( U . S . version ) , 6-26- 78 , pages 32-40 . ] And then there are the ' cold fusion ' experiments that have been in the news lately , originally conducted by University of Utah researchers B . Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann . Some U . S . Navy researchers at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California , under the direction of chemist Melvin Miles , finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus , had them analyzed with mass-spectrometry techniques , and found HELIUM 4 , which PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place , and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated . There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called " laws " of thermodynamics are NOT so " absolute " . For example , the late Physicist Dewey B . Larson developed a comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , which he calls the ' Reciprocal System ' , ( which he describes in detail in several books such as " Nothing But Motion " ( 1979 ) and " The Universe of Motion " ( 1984 ) ) , in which the physical universe has TWO DISTINCT HALVES , the material half and an anti-matter half , with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing between them , with-OUT the " heat death " predicted by thermodynamic " laws " . His Theory explains the universe MUCH BETTER than modern orthodox theories , including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about , and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way . Some Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow , seemingly converting " low-quality energy " into " high-quality energy " . Also , certain religious organizations such as ' Sant Mat ' and ' Eckankar ' teach their Members that the physical universe is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of existence , like parallel universes , or analogous to TV channels , as described in books like " The Path of the Masters " , by Dr . Julian Johnson , 1939 , and " Eckankar : The Key to Secret Worlds " , by Sri Paul Twitchell , 1969 . For example , the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the ' Astral Plane ' . Long-time Members of these groups have learned to ' Soul Travel ' into these higher worlds and report on conditions there . It seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe , or be created at the boundary between them , given the right configuration of matter to channel it . This is supported by many successful laboratory-controlled experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world , such as those described in the book " Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain " . In terms of economics , the market has FAILED . Inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment , and the conventional energy producer $ have no desire to do so because of their VE $ TED INTERE $ T $ . The government is needed to intervene . If the government does not intervene , then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out , prices for energy will increase , and pollution and its harmful effects ( including the ' GREENHOUSE EFFECT ' , acid rain , smog , radioactive contamination , oil spills , rape of the land by strip mining , etc . ) will continue to increase . The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development of Free Energy by Inventors and universities , subsidize private production ( until the producers can make it on their own ) , and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of Free Energy Hardware . The long-range effects of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound . The quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer $ ( coal mining companie $ , oil companie $ and countries , electric utilitie $ , etc . ) would drop to near zero , forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere . Energy resources ( coal , uranium , oil , and gas ) would be left in the ground . Prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero , while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases ( as happened with VCR's , personal computers , etc . ) . Costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease , along with their prices to consumers . Consumers would be able to realize the " opportunity costs " of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel . Tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars . Government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way . AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR . Many conventional energy producer $ would go out of business , but society as a whole , and the earth's environment and ecosystems , would benefit greatly . It is the People , that government should serve , rather than the big corporation $ and bank $ .

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of " right " and " wrong " ( or " correct / incorrect " or " true / false " ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is " right " ( correct , true , veridical ) or " wrong " ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply can't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the " rightness " of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one cannot feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the " correctness " of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . - - - John A .

Do you mean by " omnipotent " that God should be able to do anything / everything ? This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless . To be descriptive , omnipotence must mean " being all-powerful " and not " being able to do anything / everything " . Let me illustrate by analogy . Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth . Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations . The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit . The US would be militarily " omnipotent " . But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine / philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation , such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states . Technically ( in this scenario ) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess . But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference . If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough , then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated . Effectively , the US would be limited in what it could actually do , although it had the power to do " whatever it wanted " . The US would simply " never want to interfere " for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy . God is effectively limited in the same sense . He is all powerful , but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He , Himself is .

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians " Creation Science " on any topic . It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran , to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded . It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then " interpret " passages to match those findings . People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time .

The second party fallaciously responds by saying " see , the source really does say B , it's right here !

For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all . You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest . It is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to think about . It's not either or . Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind . I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily applied to god and religion . It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning , but there is overwhelming reason every single day , day in and day out , for _everyone_ to put his faith and dogma there .

It does no one any good to deny it . > It only makes the more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting the > bad ones . Can you see that ? I don't deny this fact . The thrust of my argument here is that ( a ) Salameh is , according to US law , innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law . As his guilt has not been established , it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption . ( b ) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents . If Muslims - - who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this - - perform such actions , it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam , but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of Islam . This is an important distinction . I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say " Muslim " . In general , anyone who calls themselves a " Muslim " and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim . Thus , one who might do things contrary to Islam ( through ignorance , for example ) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim . If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles , though , then one does leave Islam . The term " Muslim " is to be contrasted with " Mu'min " , which means " true believer " . However , whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God ( and perhaps that person himself ) . So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism , because it is not known to anybody ( except myself and God ) , whether I , for example , am a " true believer " or not . For example , I could just be putting on a show here , and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here , without anyone knowing . Thus , when we say " Muslims " we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam , whether in practice they might , in ignorance , transgress Islamic teachings . By " Muslim " we do not necessarily mean " Mu'min " , or " true believer " in Islam .

Correct me if I am wrong , but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews .

Either there is some connection between the text , the fact that it exists , and your interpretation of it , or it is purely arbitrary .. Further , the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better . You might answer that one can't becuase some peculiar Biblical information might be lost , but that holds true of every other book , and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place ?

And the argument you have given is a fallacy , while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not , it can be crucial in other questions . Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way , and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god .

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism ; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ . Your generalisms are then misplaced - - atheism needn't imply materialism , or the lack of an absolute moral system . However , I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality , so I'll answer your questions . > How then can an atheist judge value ? An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does : according to a personal understanding of morality . That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one . I'm just explicit , as in the line of postings you followed up , that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad . My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me , be they Christians , Muslims , or atheists . So when I say that I object to genocide , I'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds . If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does , my answer would be mechanistic to your taste - - that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society , and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies , thereby achieving considerable survival advantages . You'd probably say that God just made the rules . Neither of us can convince the other , but we share a common understanding about many moral issues . You think you get it from your religion , I think I get it ( and you get it ) from early childhood teaching . > That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God > or God's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your > nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled > with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books , but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're saying . I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as " God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites " is mechanistic , but of course I think that's true of you as well . My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does , but if a god existed who commanded genocide , I could not consider him good , which is supposedly an attribute of God . > All of this being so , you have excluded > yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , > etc . and cannot participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no > weight whatsoever . Hmm . Yes , I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good . I have as much place discussing values etc . as any other person . In fact , I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion , by framing the questions in terms of reason : for instance , it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands , then the quality of life will be generally poor , so a system that fosters coexistence is superior , if quality of life is an agreed goal . An absolutist , on the other hand , can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with , and say " this is good " , even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion . The attempt to define someone or a group of people as " excluded from discussion " , such that they " cannot participate " , and their opinions given " no weight whatsoever " is the lowest form or reasoning ( ad hominem / poisoning the well ) , and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right , wrong , and the Bible . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

Of course B . M . is not incorrect . He is defending Islam . When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you . But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using " petty sarcasm " . So B .

I take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent . You could be right , but it sounds plausible to me . Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand ? Here's some more : Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid - 1700s Indians were not only invited to participate in the deliberations of our " founding fathers , " but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany Plan of Union , and later the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution . That this would be absent from our school texts , and from history , and from media is not surprising given the devotion Americans feel to our founding myth : Great men gathered to express a new vision that has withstood the test of time . If it were revealed that Indians had a role in it , imagine the blow to the American psyche .
   ... By 1754 , when most of these men and others gathered to creat the Albany Plan of Union , the first try at confederation , they invited forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors on confederate structures . Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at Albany Congress : " It would be a strange thing ... if six nations of ignorant savages [ sic ] should be capable of forming such a union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted for ages and appears indissoluble , and yet that a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies . " According to Grinde , Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs and congressional delegates in order to " hammer out a plan that he acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy . " Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde , Jr . , of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation _ addresses this issue . - - Doug Graham dgraham@bnr.ca My opinions are my own .From : danb@shell.portal.com ( Dan E Babcock ) Subject : Re : some thoughts .

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation ` Rabbi ' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary ` scripture ' Mat 21:42 Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures ... Mat 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing Mat 22:29 the scriptures , nor the power of God . Following from this , he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies , and the NT says as much : Mat 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , Mat 26:54 that thus it must be ? Mat 26:56 But all this was done , that the scriptures of the Mat 26:56 prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples Mat 26:56 forsook him , and fled .

For one , your claim that everyone senses it #is not founded , and you have been asked to give evidence for it often . #And then , the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it #is there unless evidence against it has been found . I have no problem with the second statement . I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey , and was offered by some other people too : essentially , that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom . It's a good point , and I'm thinking about it . # #Your trick is to say , I feel A is not right , and so do many I know , #therefore A is absolutely right . It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process , #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process . In other words , refutes it . You make the ontological #claim , you have to prove it . Nonsense . My " trick " is to say : I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . Best evidence is therefore that A really is better than B , subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B , and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent . Now get this : " really is better " is an idealisation , a fictional model , in the same sense that " real material existence " is a fictional model . It may or may not correspond to something true . It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_ . Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist " trick " , to wit : I feel that A is better than B , and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . However , if even one person disagrees that A is better than B , or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B , then it is the case that B is better than A for that person , and nothing more can be said . I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B ( e . g . a terrorist ) . To do that would be to claim that a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist's - which would , of course , be true , but a no-no for an ethical relativist . To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words , and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion . # > #For a similar argument , I sense morality is subjective , it does not # > #hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by # > #others . # > # > If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively # > wrong , and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this # > is possible .

Yup , I think you're right . My mistake . Now , how do I make an " R " backwards using a computer keyboard ? I'll bet the gods know how ( this is alt.atheism , after all ) .

The term god is used in a different way usually . When you use a different definition it is your thing , but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist , it is existence itself , so I say it does not exist . Interestingly , there are those who say that " existence exists " is one of the indubitable statements possible . Further , saying god is existence is either a waste of time , existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god , or you are implying more with it , in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete , making it a fallacy .

Gillow , noted geneticist , has revealed some unusual data after working undercover in the Vatican for the past 18 years . " The Popehat ( tm ) is actually an advanced bone spur . " , reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report . Gillow , who had secretly studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair , first approached the scientific community with his theory in the late 1950 ' s . " The whole hat thing , that was just a cover up . The Vatican didn't want the Catholic Community ( tm ) to realize their leader was hefting nearly 8 kilograms of extraneous bone tissue on the top of his skull . " , notes Gillow in his report . " There are whole laboratories in the Vatican that experiment with tissue transplants and bone marrow experiments . What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400 ' s is now scientifically engineered and bred for . The whole bone transplant idea started in the mid sixties inspired by doctor Timothy Leary transplanting deer bone cells into small white rats . " Gillow is quick to point out the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr . Leary from the public eye . " When it becomes time to replace the pope " , says Gillow , " The old pope and the replacement pope are locked in a padded chamber . They butt heads much like male yaks fighting for dominance of the herd . The victor emerges and has earned the privilege of inseminating the choir boys .

For one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon . Unlike a football . Further , you conveniently ignore here that there are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something . The analogy does not hold . One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a set of morals YOU have to give . Further , the above is evidence , not proof . Proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories .

Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity , -> in the process he became a Christian himself . Sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy .

Logic alert - artificial trifercation . The are many other possible explainations . Could have been that he never existed .

Who would -> die for a lie ? Wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar ? People -> gathered around him and kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing -> someone who was or had been healed . Call me a fool , but I believe he did -> heal people . Logic alert - argument from incredulity . Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true . Liars can be very pursuasive , just look at Koresh that you yourself site . He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die . By not giving up after getting shot himself , Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes . As far as healing goes . If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels . In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today . Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling , so the stories got bigger to appeal better . -> Niether was he a lunatic . Would more than an entire nation be drawn -> to someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example -> anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool , logical people see -> this right away . -> Therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic , he must have been the -> real thing . Or might not have existed , or any number of things . That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into . There are bifurcations ( or tri , quad , etc ) that are valid , because in the proceeding steps , the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible . Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are , then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent , and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives . However , if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive , then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid , even if the true choice is one of the original choices . I have given at least one valid alternative , so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid . -> Some other things to note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in -> the psalms , Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone . This in his betrayal -> and Crucifixion . I don't have my Bible with me at this moment , next time I -> write I will use it . JC was a rabbi . He knew what those prophecies were . It wouldn't be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy . What would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then , yet fullfilled them anyway . -> I don't think most people understand what a Christian is .

What right do we have to interfere ? IMO , it isn't often that interference ( i . e . jail , and force of various kinds and degrees ) is both necessary and effective .

One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom . # # The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem # > that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem # > to agree that some level of interference is necessary . # #They see the need for a " justice " system .

Aids is neither spread only through sex nor necessarily spread by having sex . Futher , the point is , a very important point , the urge for sex is stronger than the fear of AIDS . It is even stronger than the religious attempts to channel or to forbid sex . The consequences of suppressing sex are worse than the consequences of Aids . Please note that the idea that everybody would end up with AIDS when sex is not controlled is completely counterfactual . And since you have brought up the point , is your god evil or not ?

It amazes me that you have the audacity to say that human creation was not the result of the natural process of evolution ( but rather an " act of God " ) and then in the same post say that these other processes ( volcanos et al . ) are natural occurrences .

Note that " ( the celestial bodies ) " in the above verse is an interpolation ( which is why it is in brackets ) - - it is the translator's ( incorrect , IMHO ) interpretation .

Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion . " ( Qur'an : 33 ) The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr .

Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have to acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos and biases . Some scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof for the theory .

Not really . I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ( $ 7,500 , 000 I believe ) , especially considering the outcome . My point was that mass suicides in the U .

Thus while I believe that no gods exist , this does ^ ^ ^ > not imply * faith * on my part that it is so . ^ ^ ^ Let me first say that " to believe that no gods exist " is in fact different than " not believing in a god or gods " . I will argue that your latter statement , " I believe that no gods exist " does rest upon faith - that is , if you are making a POSITIVE statement that " no gods exist " ( strong atheism ) rather than merely saying I don't know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then ( weak atheism ) . Once again , to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist . I still maintain the position , even after reading the FAQs , that strong atheism requires faith . But first let me say the following . We might have a language problem here - in regards to " faith " and " existence " . I , as a Christian , maintain that God does not exist . To exist means to have being in space and time . God does not HAVE being - God IS Being . Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist , He is eternal . With this said , I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called " existence " of God - and that is not what I'm doing here . I believe that God is the source and ground of being . When you say that " god does not exist " , I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it . However , in what follows I will use the phrase " the existence of God " in it's ' usual sense ' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it . I would like a clarification upon what you mean by " the existence of God " . We also might differ upon what it means to have faith . Here is what Webster says : faith 1a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b ( 1 ): fidelity to one's promises ( 2 ): sincerity of intentions 2a ( 1 ): belief and trust in and loyalty to God ( 2 ): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b ( 1 ): firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^ ^ ^ ( 2 ): complete trust 3 : something that is believed esp . with strong conviction ; esp : a system ^ ^ ^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist . When you say that you believe God does not exist , and that this is an opinion " based upon observation " , I will have to ask " what observtions are you refering to ? " There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief . All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to ( by predisposed I mean , for example , people whoes partents " believe in God " also tend to ) . To actually draw a conclusion about the " existence " or " non-existence " of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say " I believe that God does / does not exist " . Personally , I think that both statements are misguided . Arguing over the " existence " of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him ( and yes , I use " Him " because a personal God is the only viable concept ( IMO ) - if a person wants to use " She " go ahead . Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise . If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to . ) And please , if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling . If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs , or if they they think I have not read them well enough , just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation .

An interesting question would be if atoms > are objects ( classical ) or phenomenon ( neo-quantum ) or what ? I've been following this train of talk , and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense " not real " leaves me uneasy . It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects , and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real . The tree outside my window is in this category ... is observe the light which bounces off of it , not the tree itself . The observation is indirect , but no more so than observations I have made of atoms . Also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms . I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time . Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either . One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field . What I read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring . Anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it worked .

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is a complete lie and deception , as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving . Liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , almost always at the cost to another . Whos liberty is more inalienable ? Similarly for right of life . When one person must die if he is to save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty , especially for serial killers . Whos life and liberty is more valuable , the serial killer , or the victim ? According to that beautiful line , those two rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able to remove them . This _includes_ government . Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and / or liberty , but is not his own life / liberty inviolate also ?

It depends on how he defines God . The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science . Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them . Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable , and especially subserviant in a basic way , to religious dogma . This pursuit always fails . > I think I got his point - - I can quote the section if I'm being vague . > The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates .

Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way . It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits . Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers , at best . Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions . More questions can be posed than it can answer . At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction .

You got me thinking now ! This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a move in society to classify previously " socially unacceptable " yet legal activities as OK . In the past it seems to me there were always two coexisting methods of social control . First ( and most explicit ) is legal control . That is the set of actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set of punishments . Secondly ( and somewhat more hidden ) is social control . These are the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered by legal control , are scrictly controled by social censure . Ideally ( if socialization is working as it should ) legal control is hardly ever needed since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of social censure . The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as " guilt " and " morality " . I've heard it said ( and fully believe ) that if it weren't for the VAST majority of people policing themselves , legal control would be absolutely impossible . Lately ( last 50 , 100 years ? ) however there has been a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ( ie . if it ain't illegal , then don't pick on me ) . I'm not saying this is wrong , merely that it is a byproduct of a society which has : 1 ) A high education level , 2 ) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media , 3 ) A high level of institutionalized individual rights , and 4 ) A " me " oriented culture . I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition , here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can \ can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness , yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as those freedoms don't impinge on another's . IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here . While we appreciate and persue individual rights ( these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instincts ) , the removal of socialized , inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the continued destabilization of society . I got no quick fix . I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess . I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms in order to " stabilize " society . Yet I believe development of societies follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability . Can we find a social model which maximizes indiv . freed . ' s yet is stable ? Perhaps it is possible to live with a " non-stable " society ? Anybody see a way out ? Comments ? PS . Therefore answer to question # 3 : We don't . Do we want to ?

King ( king@ctron.com ) posts a whopping one liner : * " The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * * treated as a matter of faith . " - - Francis Hitching * I have a few points to make about the above posting . 1 . Science is not based on and does not consist of " quotes " from either real or alleged experts . Critical reasoning , evidence and ( if possible ) experimentation are necessary . Creationists frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike ( some of the latter quotes are in fact false ) and steadfastly refusing to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure . This strongly suggests that ( a . ) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and ( b . ) they are aware of this fatal deficiency . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 2 . You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his statement . Why is that ? If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology . Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientists . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 3 . Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of " the modern theory of evolution " would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody . It is also important to note that disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid . Creationists seem rather fond of diving ( head first ) into this logical fallacy . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 4 . Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack on evolution ( either the fact or the theory ) really represents an attack on science . While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve ( B ^ ) the fact of evolution will not ever go away . Creationists lost the battle long ago ( more than 100 years in fact ) but are simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant . Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub ( kv07@IASTATE.EDU ) asks : * Neither I , nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings . Who is he ? * I , like Hitchings , am not to be found in Webster's B ^ ) . Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist ( or perhaps he is just playing the part of one ) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ( " The Neck of the Giraffe " ) . In that publication he quotes a creationist ( Jean Sloat Morton ) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance . Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution ( the two are quite independent ) but also concluding with a " non sequitur " ( i . e . the conclusion " does not follow " ) . [ pp 70-71 ] Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism . [ pp 84 ] Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times ( and repeated in the Oregonian ) . The article was titled " ` Giraffe ' sticks scientific neck out too far " . Excerpts include : " Francis Hitchings is not a biologist . " " He goes after Darwin like Mark Antony after Brutus . He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman . " " He suggests a mystical ` organizing principle ' of life , using the similarity of organs in different creatures as evidence [ sic ] . " Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it . If John E . King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't surprise me much . It's also interesting that King had nothing to add ( i . e . he only posted a quote ) .

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex - - one which I personally believe has some truth . My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex . At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that , just that it is plausible . To try to convince you all of this particular point of view , I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field , etc . , in order to gather further evidence , which I simply do not have time to do now . Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is " a prime cause " ( in my opinion ) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems , especially depression , in Western societies . I am not saying it is " the prime cause " or " the only cause " , just " a prime cause " - - i . e . one of the significant contributions to this trend . I think when you say you think my view is simplistic , you have forgotten this - - I admit that there are probably other factors , but I do think that extra-marital sex ( and , IMO , subsequent destabilization of the family ) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century .

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man ' s Religions _ by John B . Noss . It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing . It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading . It doesn't " compare " religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities . But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based . In fact , Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages . The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began ( India , East Asia , Near East ) . There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs , Mayas , Incas , etc . Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays . And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way . If you like the old stuff , then a couple of books called " The Ancient Near East " by James B . Pritchard are pretty cool . Got the Epic of Gilgamesh , Code of Hammurabi , all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods were men .

That depends not only on their predisposition towards murder , but also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability to commit the same crimes again .

Actually , it is simple . A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders of X at the time when C was committed . It doesn't matter if the physical manifestation of C is outside X . For instance , if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their files , I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom . If the US authorities wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law , they have no automatic right to do so . This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites in Holland . Holland had no anti-cracking legislation , and so it was viewed as a " hacker haven " by some US system administrators . Similarly , a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain . If they were broadcasting in Britain , they would be committing a crime . But they are not , they are broadcasting from Denmark , so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it , in spite of the apparent law-breaking . Of course , I'm not a lawyer , so I could be wrong .

That's right , and this is pretty impossible , right ? It would be ideal if we could believe for a while , just to try out religion , and only then determine which course of thought suits us best . But again , this is not possible . Not that religion warrants belief , but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits .

I looked back at this , and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed . The US has not sold Iraq any arms . Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels . Their airforce ( not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about ) , doesn't include any US equipment . Their missiles are all non-US . Their tanks are almost all soviet , with about 100 French tanks ( older ones ) . The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s . Those were not sold to Iraq .

And I * liked * it . The writing style was a little hard to get used to , but it was well worth the effort . Coming from a similar background ( Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family , and moved to England ; I grew up in New Delhi ) , it made a strong impression on me . ( And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English : the " yaar " at the end of a sentence , " Butbutbut , " the occasional hindi phrase , etc . ) At the time I still " sorta-kinda " thought of myself as a muslim , and I couldn't see what the flap was all about . It seemed clear to me that this was allegory . It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives , and had not ( as my grandfather thundered ) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes ; in short , every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely . ( And I won't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book . Oops , I just did ! ) Perhaps in a deep sense , the book is insulting to Islam , because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent ? She can come directly to me , can't she ? How do we know that Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something ? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up , or put in their own little verses ? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women , when no other muslim is allowed to ?

It is surprising to note that a large majority of people , at least in Finland , seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland , religious people are actually a minority . Could it be possible that many people believe in god " just in case " ? It seems people do not want to seek the truth ; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments . A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly . The majority doesn't care - it believes , but doesn't know what or how .

A Christian would say that they are not " born in the Spirit " , but this does not disturb them . Religion is not something to think about . I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream .

Science is based on commonly agreed values ( interpretation of observations ) , although science can result in a reinterpretation of these values . > Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are > applicable to everyone .

Nevertheless , Khomeini offered a cash prize for people to > take the law into their own hands - - something which , to my > understanding , is against Islamic law . Yes , this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws . However , I believe there are also certain legal rulings which , in all five schools of law ( 4 sunni and 1 jaffari ) , can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims , both within and outside dar-al-islam . I do not know if apostasy ( when accompanied by active , persistent , and open hostility to Islam ) falls into this category of the law . I do know that historically , apostasy has very rarely been punished at all , let alone by the death penalty . My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy ( alone ) . It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an , hadith , or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy . I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of " fasad " . This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals . The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran . > Stuff deleted > Also , I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that > Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book . My > understanding is that Khomeini's fatwa was issued in response to the > _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book . If my view is correct , then > your viewpoint that Rushdie was sentenced for a " crime in progress " is > incorrect . > I would concur that the thrust of the fatwa ( from what I remember ) was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book . However , the charge of " fasad " can encompass a number of lesser charges . I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author , and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the " crisis " . But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa . Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people , not books . The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa . Rushdie went on a media blitz , presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred . Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book , he was everywhere in the media . Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book . Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned , then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights . It was at this point that the fatwa on " fasad " was issued . The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling . The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers . The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well . The crime was certainly a crime in progress ( at many levels ) and was being played out ( and played up ) in the the full view of the media . P . S . I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of " shatim " also applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the " fasad " ruling .From : madhaus@netcom.com ( Maddi Hausmann ) Subject : Re : Amusing atheists and agnostics timmbake@mcl.ucsb.edu ( " Half " Bake Timmons ) writes : > Maddi : > > > > Whirr click whirr ...

How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known > what * not to include * in the Holy Qur'an ( assuming he had authored > it ) ? This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue . The book is in two sections . Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible , showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science . Well we all know that , no surprises . Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories , and seems , on the face of it , to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science . However , it was plain to me , that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran . Take the flood , for example , the bible is full of detail , ( " forty days and forty nights " , " pair of every animal " , etc . ) , we all know this is nonsense . The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as " A big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage " . Yes , no contradiction but also not much fact . The Koran might be consistent with modern science , but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time , does not seem much of an achievement . The book concludes by saying something like , the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of ( to us now ) ridiculous ideas about the universe , and none of them can be found in the Koran ! Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme .

In other words , I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless . In Ontology , one can fairly conclude that when " A exist " is meaningless A does not exist . Under the Pragmatic definition of truth , " A exists " is meaningless makes A exist even logically false . A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition , and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense . The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all .

So the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is if it contradicts the Quran ? What if it relates to something that isn't explicitly spelled out in the Quran ? Also , the Quran wasn't written down during the life of Muhammed either . It wasn't long after , but 20 years or so is still long enough to shift a few verses around .

It's like asking people to " try dying to find out what > death is like " . Well now , we can't judge death until we are dead right ? So , why should we judge religion without having experienced it ? People have said that religion is bad by any account , and that it is in no way useful , etc . , but I don't totally agree with this . Of course , we cannot really say how the religious folk would act had they not been exposed to religion , but some people at least seemed to be helped in some ways by it . So basically , we can not judge whether religion is the right route for a given individual , or even for a general population .

It sounds as if you are proceeding with just the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of . I always preceeded my statements with " it is my understanding that ... " Now , I have made my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility . After hearing your seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim regarding himself , I have withdrawn that portion of my statement regarding that claim . However , I have received _no_ such response regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams . There is nothing obfuscationist about my claims , which are always made clearly . I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and other such opaque " concepts " often used by people to camoflage the baselessness of their positions , particularly in matters of theology . These are just the sorts of " concepts " used by Christian churches the perverting of their religion . > As salaam a-laikum Alaikum Wassalam , GreggFrom : frank@D012S658.uucp ( Frank O'Dwyer ) Subject : Re : Bayesian Statistics , theism and atheism In article <1993Apr24.165301.8321@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk ( Simon Clippingdale ) writes : #In article <1quei1$8mb@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp ( Frank O'Dwyer ) writes : # > In article <1993Apr15.181924.21026@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk ( Simon Clippingdale ) writes : [ I write :] # > > > Imagine that 1000000 Alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every # > > > month .

When you say ( paraphrased ) #in ( 2 ) that this is not " evidence for [ benefactor ] " , for example , what you #mean is that it's no * more * evidence for [ benefactor ] than it is for [ bug ] . Yes , that's what I mean . #In ( 3 ) , however , you've shifted the meaning of " evidence for [ benefactor ] " #so that it now means ` absolute ' " evidence for [ benefactor ] " rather than # ` relative ' " evidence for [ benefactor ] " w . r . t . [ bug ] . Not really , I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other . I think this is just a communications problem . What I am trying to say , in my clumsy way , is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions ( prayer , your ' Rapture ' example ) , I don't buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A = 0 . In my example , one couldn't dismiss [ benefactor ] or [ bug ] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary to explain the dosh . I brought up the ' one-by-one dismissal ' process to show that it would be wrong to do so . From what you're saying in this post , it seems you agree , and we're talking at cross-purposes . # ( 3 ) is still in contradiction to ( 1 ) . # #Some sums may help . With B = benefactor , b = bug , d = dosh arrives in account : # # ( 1 ) implies P ( B + b | d ) = 1 # #Assuming that P ( Bb | d ) = 0 , so it's either the benefactor * or * a bug #which is responsible if the bucks arrive , but not both , then # # P ( B + b | d ) = P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) # #so # # P ( B | d ) + P ( b | d ) = 1 # #but ( 3 ) implies that # # P ( B | d ) = 0 and P ( b | d ) = 0 . No , this isn't what I meant . P ( B | d ) = 0.5 and P ( b | d ) = 0.5 , with necessarily no new observation ( we've already seen the dosh ) to change those estimates . I was trying to say ( again , in my clumsy way ) that it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these . And that's precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are one class of hypothesis ( there are many others ) belonging to a set of hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise would _not_ be satisfactorily explained . It can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non-rational preference , not of science or statistics . Alternatively , one could chuck out or retain the lot , on the grounds that the answer can't be known , or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless , being equal ( agnosticism / weak atheism ) . # > As they do when the set M is filled by " the universe is caused by x " , # > where x is gods , pink unicorns , nothing , etc . - and no observation # > tends to one conclusion over the other . # #Exactly the point I was making , I think .

See my post on the other branch of this #thread . Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of . If the razor holds for gods , then it holds for all like hypotheses . Which means that you're assigning P ( x | H [ i ] ) = 0 for all i , though we've already established that it's not correct to do so when SUM ( P ( x | H [ i ] ) )= 1 over all i . # > Simply put , anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or # > non-existence of gods , whether inductive or no , is at best mistaken , and # > at worst barking mad . # #Luckily I make no such claim , and have specifically said as much on numerous #occasions .

If it * reduces * this quantity , it's still #evidence against H . No , I got that . I'm talking about the case when A = 0 . You're clearly correct when A ! = 0 . And I'm not constructing a strawman ( though it's certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying ) . However , by any standards , a system that says when A = 0 , gods are highly unlikely , and when A ! = 0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor , is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist , or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena . In my experience , systems such as this ( including those which purport to prove that gods exist ) always contain a fallacy upon close examination . If that's not what you're saying , then please put me straight . - - Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by Evelyn ConlonFrom : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Re : some thoughts .

Bill , I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism . Lack of belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding transcendental values . I hope you would accept the fact that for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism . I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems . Cheers , Kent - - - sandvik@newton.apple.com .

Ah , now here is the core question . Let me suggest a scenario . We will grant that a God exists , and uses revelation to communicate with humans . ( Said revelation taking the form ( paraphrased from your own words ) ' This infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck , makes him take dictation , and then hides away for a few hundred years ' . ) Now , there exists a human who has not personally experienced a revelation . This person observes that not only do these revelations seem to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the observed world ( which is all this person has ever seen ) , but there are many mutually contradictory claims of revelation . Now , based on this , can this person be blamed for concluding , absent a personal revelation of their own , that there is almost certainly nothing to this ' revelation ' thing ? > I'm not an objectivist , so I'm not particularly impressed with problems of > conceptualization .

Absent this better language , and absent observations in support of the claims of revelation , can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing ? Here is what I am driving at : I have thought a long time about this . I have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity , it is nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that I am familiar with . Now , if there does happen to be , say , a Christian God , will I be held accountable for such an honest mistake ? Sincerely , Ray Ingles ingles@engin.umich.edu " The meek can * have * the Earth .

I think the following comes from John A . Johnson , but someone correct me if I'm wrong . This is probably the longest of my entire collection . ___ So that the Prophecy be Fulfilled * * * In considering the Christian religion , and judging it according to its claims , it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy . The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth . As you will see , Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages , often not even about the promised Messiah , and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament . We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts . Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed , we do not know how much happened exactly as stated . But , for purposes of analysis , we will take particular claims at face value . Immanuel : We begin , of course , at the beginning . ( Mt 1.21- 22 ): " [ Mary ] will bear a son , and you , Joseph , will name him ' Jesus ' ( which means G'd is salvation ) , for he will save his people from their sins . " All this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet : [ Isaiah 7.1- 16 ]: In the days of Ahaz ( c . 750 BCE ) , king of Judah , Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made war on Jerusalem ( capitol of Judah ) , but could not quite conquer it . When the house of David ( i . e . Ahaz and his court in Judah ) were told of this , ... its heart and the heart of its people shook ... And , the lord G'd said to Isaiah , " go to meet with Ahaz ... " ... And the lord spoke to Ahaz ( through prophet Isaiah , naturally ) saying , " Ask a sign of G'd your lord . It can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven . " But , Ahaz said , " I won't ask ; I will not put the lord to a test . " Then ( Isaiah ) said , " Hear then , O house of David . Is it not enough for you to weary men , that you must weary my god too ? Therefore , the lord himself will give you a sign : Behold , a young woman is with child and will bear a son , and name him " Immanuel , " which means , " G'd is with us . " He will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good . For , before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good , the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted ... Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics . Further , he the Hebrew word " almah , " ( young woman ) , as specifically , " virgin . " But , this is not a prophecy about the Messiah . It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later . It is not a prophecy about a virgin ( bethulah ) mother . In short , it not about Jesus . Matthew has made use of a verse out of context , and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary . It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner , a very general one , it can be made to fit Mary . Mary , virgin or not , was indeed a young woman with child . Of course , the fit is shady and has problems . Jesus , while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men , was never called by the name , Immanuel . If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus , it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy ... a second class prophecy . Not too convincing . Egypt : After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem , Matthew tells about a quick ( and elsewhere unmentioned ) excursion to Egypt , as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses . This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king , Herod . [ Mt 2.15 ] ... and remained there until the death of Herod . This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken : " Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son . " What the lord really said was this . [ Hosea 11.1 ] When Israel was a child , I loved him . And , out of Egypt I called my son . The more I called them ( my people ) , the more they went from me ; they kept sacrificing to the Ba'als , and kept burning incense to idols . Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle . But , it was indeed Israel that , once called out of Egypt , wanted to return . This is history . Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here . And , if we are to draw some kind of parallel here , we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd . Again , this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped . Rachel Weeps : While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt , Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him , and thus ordered the executions of all young male children . Matthew then writes , [ Mt 2.17- 18 ] By this , that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled : " A voice was heard in Ramah , wailing and loud lamentation - - Rachel weeping for her children ; she refused to be consoled , because they were no more . " The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15 , referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon ( of Assyria ) in 722 BCE . Rachel , the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel , Ephraim , and Manasseh , is said to weep for her descendants who are " no more . " It is metaphorical , of course , since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile . It is interesting to note that it was Leah , not Rachel , who was the ancestor of the Judeans ( the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were ) . If anyone should do weeping for her " children , " it is Leah . The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city , " on the way to Ephrath , ( Bethlehem ) . " As for Herod and his infanticide , it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred . One never knows , but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible , nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time . Herod was particularly unliked in his reign , and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded . This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel . Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt , it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic , yet artificial , approval of Jesus . It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote . The " children " the prophet speaks of are not dead , but exiled in the Assyrian Empire . G'd comforts the weeping Rachel , saying that the children will be returned - - he will gather them back together . Of course , this would not suit Matthew's purpose , as the children he speaks of are dead for good . Again , the " prophecy " Matthew sets up is not even that , and to anyone who bothers to check it out , is not too convincing . The Nazarene : We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy . After leaving Egypt , Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth , [ Mt 2.23 ] ... that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled , " He shall be called a Nazarene . " First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet ( s ) this time . Second , we have to ask who " He " is . There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene . Worse , there are no prophecies , period , mentioning a Nazarene . Still worse , there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all . In the book of Judges , an angel tells Samson's mother that she will , [ Judges 13.5 ] " ... conceive and bear a son . No razor shall tough his head , for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his birth . He will deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines . " This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus , or the messiah of G'd . But , it is the best that can be found . Obviously , Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies , in that he is simple making them up now . Bearing our Diseases : Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities . [ Mt 8.17 ] This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah , " He took our infirmities and bore our diseases . " As expected , the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context , and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme . We have , [ Is 53.4 ] Surely he , [ the suffering servant ] , has borne our sickness , and carried our pains . From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah , we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel , Jehovah's chosen servant and people . He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile , in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it . This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity - - an image of a chastised , yet cherished , Israel as the instrument of the nations ' salvation by G'd . The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline . They do not speak of a " servant " going around and healing people . Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations ( and individual Jews ) . Jesus , as we all know , did not take the diseases onto himself . The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come , but rather something that had already happened . While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell , he did not bear the illnesses he healed . So , while someone might want to say that , figuratively , Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement , he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect . Silent Messiah : Upon healing multitudes of commoners , it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet , presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers . [ Mt 12.15- 21 ] This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah . " Behold my servant whom I have chosen , my beloved , with whom my soul is pleased . I will put my spirit on him , and he will announce justice to the Gentiles . He will not wrangle or cry aloud , nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets . He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory , and the gentiles will hope in his name . " The Isaiah passage quoted reads , [ Is 42.1- 4 ] Behold my servant whom I uphold , my chosen , in whom my soul delights . I have put my spirit on him , and he will bring forth justice to the nations . We will not cry or lift up his voice , or make it heard in the street . He will not break a bruised reed , or quench a smoldering wick . He will faithfully bring forth justice . He will not fail ( burn dimly ) or be discouraged ( bruised ) until he has established justice in the earth . And the coastlands await his law . You see , Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage , because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus . Christians could never think of Jesus failing , never would the " light " of mankind burn dimly . But , the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done . When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people , but rather all will be the children of G'd . Also , the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic " ... the coastlands await his law . " to the Christologic , " the Gentiles will hope in his name . " While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah , the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of " believing in the name . " If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus , one has only to read the whole chapter , Isaiah 42 , and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant , " a people robbed and plundered ... " So , we see that when Matthew's attempt at " prophecy " is examined , it crumbles . Three Days and Three Nights : Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself . He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection . [ Mt 12.40 ] For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights , so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights . Before any further discussion can occur , it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days . As far as day names went , each was 24 hours long , lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm . What was referred to as a " day " was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm . Thus , according to our time scale , a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening , and lasted until 6pm saturday evening . This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays , instead of Sundays . ( It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week ! ) Thus , when days and nights are referred to together , 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of . Thus , Jesus says that he will be in the grave , or in hell , or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights . As the good book tells us , Jesus was crucified on the " ninth hour , " which is 3pm , Friday afternoon . He then was put into the grave sometime after that . Then , Jesus left the grave , " rose , " before dawn of what we call Sunday ( The dawn after the sabbath was over ) . What this means is that Jesus was , using our time for clarity , in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning . We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday , since the bible is not specific here . What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day , two nights , and possibly a couple of hours of one day . Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction . There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights - - even using modern time measurements . We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes , and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth . And no matter who made the prediction , it is more than unconvincing ... it is counter-convincing . Hearing & Understanding : Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables - - stories in which a deeper meaning could be found , if you were already one of the elect , those chosen to understand the message of Jesus . He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants . If the people cannot understand them , there is no need to bother with them , since they will not accept the " plain " message any better . Matthew says , [ Mt 13.14- 16 ] With them [ the audience ] indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says , " You will indeed hear but never understand ; and you will indeed see , but never perceive . Because this people's heart has grown dull , their ears are heavy of hearing , and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them , her with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn for me to heal them . " The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works , his call to the ministry . This is in 740 BCE , when Israel is flourishing , right before it falls under the authority of Assyria . Isaiah sees the good times ending , and also a vision from G'd , calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah . [ Is 6.9- 13 ] And G'd said , " Go , and say to this people , ` Hear and hear , but do not understand ; see and see , but do not perceive . ' Make the heart of this people fat , make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes , so they will not see with their eyes , or hear with their ears , and understand with their hearts , and turn and be healed . " Then Isaiah said , " How long , lord ? " And he said , " Until the cities lie waste without inhabitant , and houses without men , and the land is utterly desolate , and the G'ds take men far away , and forsaken places are many in the land . And though a tenth will remain in it , it will be burned again , like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled . " The holy seed is its stump . Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings , but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's ( and David's ) seed / lineage . If you read the rest of Isaiah , you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant , a light to the nations . ( Look at Isaiah 42.18- 25 , 48.20 , 49.3 ) We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse , to suit his own gospel needs . More than that , he has altered the words , to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories . And , as we see , Isaiah's verses are not prophecies , but rather commands from G'd to him , in the present . Once again , Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face . Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval . [ Mt 13.35 ] ... he said nothing to them without a parable . This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet , " I will open my mouth to them in parables . I will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world . " Matthew really botches up here . He attempts to quote not from a prophet , but from the Psalms . [ Ps 78.2- 4 ] I will open my mouth in parable . I will utter dark sayings of old , things that we all have heard and known , things that our fathers have told us . We will not hide them from their children , but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord ... As was pointed out , the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet . You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet . Apparently , later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up . Perhaps the most significant part of this is that , once again , Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures . As Jesus has said earlier , he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them . The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden . Further , they speak of things " known , that our fathers have told us . " Jesus deals with things " hidden since the foundation of the world . " Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion . This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms . No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them ! And still once again , Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face . But , Christians rarely look at this . Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad . Excuses of Little Faith : In Mt . 17.14- 21 , we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons , except in one case . Not knowing what epilepsy was , the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons . It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to " dispossess " the epileptic . But , Jesus , perhaps no more enlightened than they , is reported to have rebuked them , saying they didn't have enough faith . This seems strange . Why was this demon special ? It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not . Apparently , enough faith will allow someone to move mountains . Of course , you will find no one , these days that can move real mountains . No one parts seas . The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place . Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T . V . And the gods , including Jesus , are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings , protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts . They are either dead , sleeping , or hiding in heaven , with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone . Yet , life goes on . Tales of mystics , stories of miracles - - all in a distant time or a distant place . Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days , Jehovah too . But , now they are silent . All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore . We're too lazy ; we're not zealous enough ; we're sinful ; it's just his " plan " ; we put too many of our own demands on G'd's appearance ; if we had the right faith , if we were willing to meet G'd on his terms ... Yet , even the most pious of men have not seen G'd . You , dear reader , have not seen G'd . Not literally , you know that to be true . ( I know that's presumptuous and bold . But , searching your heart , you know what I mean . ) All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd . They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd . Sometimes , they say , " See the love in these people you worship with ... see the lives of people change ... that is seeing G'd . " Thus people get lulled to sleep , satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights . But , that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of ... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see . What we see in the world that is good , is the compassion of human hearts , the love given and taken by men and women , the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike , beauty created by the mind of man . These are the things that are done ; these are what we see . But , it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith . Jesus Rides on an Ass : Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king , Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem . [ Mt 21.5 ] This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet , saying , Tell the daughter of Zion , " Behold , your king is coming to you , humble , mounted on an ass , and on a ass-colt . " Of course , the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently . Lo , your king comes to you ; he is triumphant and victorious , humble , and riding on an ass , on an ass - colt ... he will command peace to the nations . There isn't all that much difference here , except that Zechariah only involves one animal - - an ass-colt - - while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently . Thus , he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass . From Matthew's version , we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys . This could inevitably lead to a theological , proctological dilemma ! We find that in the account written earlier by St . Mark , only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus . This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly , and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses , he has bungled . Now , excluding many respectable Christians I have met , I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses , the situation is often reversed nowadays ... Then , entering the Jerusalem temple , the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah . But , Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done , [ Mt 21.16 ] Haven't you read ? ` Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise . ' It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little " prophetic " things AND since , as we might expect , the quote is in error , which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well . We might ask Jesus or Matthew , " Haven't you read ? " for the source reads , [ Psalms 8.1- 2 ] O YaHWeH our lord , how majestic is your name in the whole world ! You , whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants , you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger . The passages hardly need comment . There is no " perfect praise " spoken of in the psalm , and what praise is there is given to G'd , not his messiah king , and not Jesus . As mentioned , it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture . YHVH said to my lord ... : Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended . The Jews agree - - it is king David . But , then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110 , " The LORD said to my Lord , sit at my right hand , until I put your enemies under your feet . " Taken at face value , Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent . One assumes he is in opposition to their answer . Of course , the Christian answer is that he agrees , but is trying to make some hidden point , to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king . It's tempting to believe this , if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation . But , there are problems . In Jesus's time , the psalm was thought to be about the messiah . And , it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior . We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king , bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule . Of course , the Jews listening had no good answer , and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah , such as the Christians worship . The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm , an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made . One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews , often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king . Jesus was apparently one of these adventists , like his audience , who thought the messiah's advent was imminent , and who interpreted Psalms 110 , among others , as being messianic . What is the problem , then ? Psalm 110 literally reads , YHVH's utterance to my lord : " Sit at my right hand , until I make your enemies your footstool . " YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion . Rule in the midst of your foes ! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains . " You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek forever . " The word " lord " is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord . But , in the Hebrew , the word is " adoni , " and no capitalisation exists . Adoni simply means " lord , " a generic term as we would use it . It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd . It is merely an address of respect . There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king . That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain . The title of the psalm translates to either " a psalm of David , " or " a psalm about David . " It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet , about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd . If the psalm had been written by David , it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah . The idea of a perfect king , descended from David , was not present in David's age . We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings - - none of which include any praises of a messiah . Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead , in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold . The description in the psalm fit David very well . David was promised by G'd a rise to power , victory over his enemies , successful judgement among the nations he conquered . He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king , enabled to bless the people . It all fits . We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone , though . Here , there is not artificial prophecy alluded to , though his use of the scripture is rather questionable . Still , this event is common to the other gospels too . So , we let Matthew off a little more easily this time . It is interesting to note , though , how Matthew dresses up the event . The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd . Matthew has the Pharisees , who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity , be the target of Jesus's question . As we might expect , Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees . Such power is the pen . Moses & Jesus , Had it Together All Along ... : We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel . The gospel story of John deserves special treatment , because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew . But , for the moment , we will just look at one verse . The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king , and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd . When constructing the history of Abraham , Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people . While this was accomplished eventually , under the rule of king David , the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise . But , to do so , they expanded on the promise , preaching about a heavenly kingdom . [ John 8.56 ] ( J . C . speaking ) Your father , Abraham , rejoiced to see My day . He say it and was glad . It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham , but , Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah , or anything Christian . I have tried , and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy . It is par for the course to see St . John making up Old Testament backings , just like his forerunner Matthew . Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud , and it is surprising they still cling to it . The Potter's Field : We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers , Judas Iscariot . Matthew writes , [ Mt 27.5- 10 ] And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple , [ Judas ] departed ... But , the chief priests , taking the silver , said , " It isn't lawful for us to put it in the treasury , since it is blood money . " So they ... bought a potter's field with it to bury strangers in ... Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah , " And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel , and they gave them for the potter's field , as the lord directed me . " This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture . First , Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet . It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of . [ Zech . 11.12- 13 ] ... And they weighed out my wages , thirty shekels of silver . Then YHVH said to me , " Cast them to the treasury , " - - the lordly price at which I was paid off by them . So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of YHVH . First of all , the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah , or of G'd . The deal with a shepherd , most likely a priest , chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another . The word , " treasury , " had been replaced by the King James Scholars with " to the potter , " precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better . But , this is a blatant error . The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed " treasury , " which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context , whereas " potter's field " is totally unrelated . Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation . However , given Matthew's track record , one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty . Of course , Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text . The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation , and if as most Christians seem to be , the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity , Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around . However , the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests . The high priests would not put the money in the treasury . The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite ! Of course , to the average Thursday-Night Bible student , the " prophecy " as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value . To those , Matthew's work is convincing enough . Wine , Vinegar , & Casting Lots : Then , Jesus is led away to be crucified . [ Mt 27.34- 35 ] ... they gave him vinegar to drink , mingled with gall ; but when he tasted it , he would not drink it . And , when they had crucified him , they divided his garments among them by casting lots : that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet , " They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots . " First of all , the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine , of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly . We find that right before Jesus dies , the soldiers themselves give him some to drink - - not polluted with gall . [ Jn 19.28- 30 ] Jesus ... said , " I thirst . " A bowl of vinegar stood there , so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth . When he had received the vinegar , he said , " It is finished ; " But , Matthew seems to be drawing on , not a passage from the prophets , but one from the Psalms . [ Ps 69.20- 28 ] I looked for pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none . They gave me poison for food ( lit . they put gall in my meat ) , and for my thirst , they gave me vinegar to drink ... Add to them punishment upon punishment , may they have no acquittal from thee . Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Living . Of course , the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink . This does indeed seem to be a show of pity . The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies . It is not about the messiah or Jesus . It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the " Jesus " in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the " crucifiers , " whereas the Jesus of the gospels says , [ Lk 23.34 ] Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , the don't know what they do ! " Further , Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall ( a bitter substance ) put into Jesus's drink , not his meat , as the psalm stipulates . With the " prophecy " of the vinegar faulty , we naturally ask , " What of the casting of lots ? " This brings up the 22nd Psalm , which deserves discussion all by itself . Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing . It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days . As we will soon see , it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus . It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes . For a man so removed from worldly possessions , his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions . The 22nd Psalm : This psalm is attributed to David , as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies . It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope . Taken out of context , parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well . We will examine the primary passages . Verse 1-2 : My god , my god ! why have you forsaken me ? ! Why are you so far from helping me , far from the words of my groaning ? Oh , my god , I cry by day , but you don't answer , and by night , but find no rest . Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross . This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus , rather than king David . Of course , the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution . Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal , he is supposed to be like " the lamb led mute before its shearers . " Indeed , Jesus doesn't do much groaning , even when on the cross . He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross . 6-8 : But , I am a worm , and no man - - scorned by men ... All who see me mock at me . They make faces and wag their heads ; " He committed his cause to YHVH . So let him deliver him ... for he delights in him . " This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well , with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm . 12-13 : Many bulls encompass me ... they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion . 16-18 : Yea , dogs are round about me , a company of evildoers encir-cle me , they have pierced my hands and feet . I can see all my bones ... They divide my garments among them , and cast lost for my raiment . 19-21 : But you , YHVH , be not far away ! ... Deliver my soul from the sword , my life from the power of the dog ! Save me from the mouth of the lion , and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull ! It would seem quite convincing , and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too . Unfortunately , this prophecy has a fatal flaw . The words " have pierced " really do not exist in the psalm . The correct Hebrew translation is , 16 : Yea , dogs are round about me , a company of evildoers encircles me , like the lion , they are at my hands and feet ... In Hebrew the phrase " like the lion " and a very rare verb form which can mean " pierced " differ by one phonetic character . The word in the Hebrew text is literally , " like the lion " ( ka'ari ) , which makes sense in the context , and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer . It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to " ka'aru . " But , to add the needed ( yet artificial ) weight to the " prophecy " this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do . While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus , its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators . Apart from the erroneous verse 16 , the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily . Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross . This naturally fits the psalm's true subject , king David . As a side note , we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands , the palms , but rather the forearms . This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms . But then , facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs . Matthew escapes culpability this time , as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus . But the psalm , like many others , was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death . How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology . It is easy to see , for those who are not faithful fundamentalists , how some of the events in the New Testament might have been " enhanced " by scribes such as the eager Matthew . But , it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims . So far , this has not said good things for St . Matthew . The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion . John's gospel recount , written about 70 years after the fact , tells us at Jesus's execution , [ Jn 19.34 , 37 ] But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear , and out came blood and water ... these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled ... " The will look on him whom they've pierced . " Of course , this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context . Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them . [ Zc 12.7- 10 ] And YHVH will give victory to Judah ... And on that day , I will seek to destroy the nations that come against Jerusalem ( in Judah ) . And I will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication ... on Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced , they will mourn , and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child . John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts . Matthew , at least , usually excontexts more than just one passage . John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here . It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers , as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded . Reckoned with Transgressors : After his arrest , Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship , messiahship . According to one version of the gospel tale , Jesus gets executed along with two thieves . [ Mk 15.27 ] And with him they crucified two robbers , one on his right , one on his left . And so the scripture was fulfilled which says , " He was reckoned with the transgressors . " Here , Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53 , about the servant nation of Israel . The passage is not about the messiah , for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53 , and its surrounding chapters , one sees that the servant is a nation . The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past , not a prediction of what is to come , in any event . The servant is thought of as a criminal . This also happens to fit the description of Jesus . Had the passage really been about the messiah , it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the " prophecy " in Isaiah . Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry . He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career . Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy , at least in this case , as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons . Mark goes on to tell us how " those who were crucified with [ Jesus ] also reviled him . " [ 15.32 ] This is to be expected from a couple of robbers . Of course in his later recount , St . Luke decides to change some things . Luke tells us , [ Lk 23.39- 43 ] And one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed , " Aren't you the messiah ? ! Save yourself , and us ! " This certainly fits with Mark's recount , which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said , " Save yourself ! " and that the robbers did the same . But then Luke goes on , But the other [ criminal ] rebuked [ the first ] saying , " Don't you fear G'd , since you are under the same sentence of condemnation ? And we , indeed justly so , for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds . But , this man has done nothing wrong . And he said , " Jesus , remember me when you come in your kingdom . " And Jesus answered , " Verily I say to you , today you will be with me in paradise . " Now , this little dialogue seems highly contrived . It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech . We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering . Such a man , apparently noble and of principle , doesn't seem likely to have been a robber . We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke . Of course , Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's . Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus , not both . It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up , but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open . This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology . In this case , the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems , as we have seen . The End of the World - - Mt . 24 : Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament . It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories , and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity . Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings , and his disciples ask him about this , and about the end of the world which he has been warning about . The disciples : Tell us , when will this [ the temple's destruction ] be , and what will be the sign of your coming , and of the close of the age ? Jesus : Take care that no one leads you astray , for many will come in my name , saying , " I am the christ . " ... you will hear of wars and rumours of wars ... for this must take place , but the end is not yet . For , nation will rise against nation ... all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs . They will deliver you up ... put you to death , and false prophets will arise and lead many astray .
   ... But he who endures to the end will be saved . This gospel will be preached throughout the whole world , a testimony to the nations , and then the end will come . So , when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel , ... let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains . Immediately after the tribulation of those days , the sun will be darkened ... the stars will fall from heaven ... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven , and all the tribes of the earth will mourn , and see the Son of Man coming ... and he will send out his angels ... and gather his elect ... Learn the lesson of the fig tree : as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves , you know that summer is near . So also , when you see all these things , you will know that He is near , at the very gate . Truly I say to you , this generation will not pass away until all these things take place ... But , of the day and hour , no one knows ; not the angels , not the Son , but only the Father ... Therefore , you also must be ready , for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect . From this , it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples . He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour , that it will come , and thus they must be ready . Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error . But , unfortunately , Jesus made himself to explicit . He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End , and that they in particular should prepare for it , prepare to be swept away . There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible , and said that the phrase , " this generation shall not pass away ... " really means " this race of people will not pass away ... " Of course , the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that , the generation of the disciples . It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek , he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear . But . it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples ( at least some of them ) are supposed to live to the End of the World . The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles ' responses . It becomes abundantly clear from Rev . 22.7 , 1 Peter 4.7 , 1 John 2.18 , and Rev . 22.20 , that Jesus meant exactly what he said . The End was very near . For 2,000 years , Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew , or ignored its meaning altogether . For 2,000 years , they have waited for their executed leader to come back , hearing of wars , and rumours of wars , sure that He is coming soon . Surely He must be . All we must do is wait . Can you imagine how tired He must be , sitting around up there , being holy , waiting for just the right moment to spring ? So , shortly after his crucifixion , Jesus of Nazareth , ( Joshua-ben-Joseph ) , died . It is said that after three days , or three days and three nights , or three periods of time , or three eternal seconds - - or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble - - he was seen again , resurrected , glowing with divine radiance . Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around , and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven . So the story goes , anyway . As has been seen , there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down . To them , Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture . We have seen , though , that this matter is quite shaky . But , throughout Church history , Christians have held fast to faith , in simple belief . What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force , faith and forgetfulness kept away from question . To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters . Thus for 2,000 years , the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted . Things may well continue that way for some time . Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used ( properly or improperly ) to support wars and persecution , I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold . [ Mt 10.34 ] Jesus : " Don't think that I have come to bring peace on earth . I haven't come to bring peace , but rather a sword .

If all you care about is belief in a supernatural deity , and have nothing to say about behaviour , then belief in a supernatural being is your criterion . But once you start talking about behaviour , then someone's suscept - ibility to be led by bad people into doing bad things is what you are - I assume - worried about . And in that area , what you care about is whether someone is sceptical , critical and autonomous on the one hand , or gullible , excitable and easily led on the other . I would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates that a person is easily led . Whether they have a worship or belief in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be beside the point . jon .From : frank@D012S658.uucp ( Frank O'Dwyer ) Subject : Re : After 2000 years , can we say that Christian Morality is In article <1993Apr15.125245.12872@abo.fi> MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI ( Mats Andtbacka ) writes : | In <1qie61$fkt@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> frank@D012S658.uucp writes : | > In article <3 0114@ursa.bear.com > halat@pooh.bears ( Jim Halat ) writes : | | > #I'm one of those people who does not know what the word objective means | > #when put next to the word morality .

Cute characterization Bill ; however , there is no inconsistency between the two statements . Even if one believes that religion is " primitive , simple-minded and unscientific , anti-intellectual and childish " , one can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of complexity to the explanation .

I read his " Satanic Bible " a few years ago for a social studies project , as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called " The Cult of Devil Worship in America . " The latter included a very interesting interview with the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an instrument for one to realize the self . When I refer to Satanism , I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan . I don't consider LaVey's church to be at all " orthodox , " nor do I consider its followers " satanists . " LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche , Crowley , and Reich , slapped in some religious doctrine , added a little touch of P . T . Barnum , and christened his creation the Church of Satan . No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention ... I suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex . At any rate , it worked ( for a while ) . In its heyday , the Church had a huge following , including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis , Jr . and Jayne Mansfield . ( I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy , by the way . ) I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as a Christian not believing in Christ . But if you include the Church of Satan , then I suppose I need to alter my definition .

At first , the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using , not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets . But later , and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit , they changed their tone . It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war , that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare . It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was " nice and clean " ( smart missiles dropping in on military HQs ) , but not when pictures of dead , dying , and maimed civilians started cropping up .

I have often wondered about this . I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk . A good , inpenatrable military target . The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be . But I digress . Yes , I have heard that we found evidence ( after the war , BTW ) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb . Unfortunately , the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum . Therefore the second bomb was dropped . Most unfortunate , IMO . > > > I , for one , don't regret it . > > Nuke a Jap for Jesus ! > I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people .

Actually , it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action . If some back-water country took over some other back-water country , we probably wouldn't intervene . Not that we don't care , but we can't be the world's policman . Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait ( instead of an invasion ) , then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia . But the combination of the two , an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil interests , caused us to take action . > > [ I've moved a paragraph from here to later on ] > [ ... ] > > > > If we hadn't intervened , allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait , then it would > > have been appeasement . > > Right .

Hardly . I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [ tm ] to kill innocent people if the end is just . Unfortunately , we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions . If one is going to resist tyranny , then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die . I didn't say it is OK - - it is unfortunate , but sometimes necessary . > > I , a moral relativist , am arguing that saturation bombing of German cities at > the end of World War II was ( as far as I can see ) an evil and unnecessary act . I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering . I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say . That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved . And perhaps it * was * unnecessary as ( let's say ) we now know . That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary . Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision . At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it . But don't assume that I feel the bombing was * morally * justified - - I don't ! I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances . > > You , having criticised moral relativism in the past , are now arguing that I am > in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the > War .

I understand the full ramifications of that , and I am prepared to do so . I don't believe that you can make the same claim . > > mathew And BTW , the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being " so deplorable " . Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial / military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time . But in the Gulf War , precision bombing was the norm . So the point was , why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted * in spite of * precision bombing , when so many more civilians ( proportionately and quantitatively ) died under the blanket bombing in WW2 ? Even with precision bombing , mistakes happen and some civilians suffer . But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history ! Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids . The stories of " hundreds of thousands " of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk . Yes , bunk . The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! But we are expected to swallow that " hundreds of thousands " of * civilian * Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months ! And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that ! What hogwash . If " hundreds of thousands " of Iraqi civilians died , it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people , not due to the Allied bombing .

That ( " complicated " ) isn't in fact where P ( H ) > P ( HG ) comes from ; it's more the other way around . It's from P ( H ) = P ( HG ) + P ( HG ' ) where G ' is the complement of G and by axiom , P ( anything ) > = 0 , so P ( HG ' ) > = 0 , so P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) . In a sense , HG is necessarily more " complicated " than H for any H and G , so I may be splitting hairs , but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is , P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) holds , with equality if and only if P ( HG ' ) = 0 . > As you point out , it's a very simple matter to show P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) > = = > P ( H | x ) > P ( HG | x ) , and thus H is to be preferd to HG . Now to say > that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P ( x | H ) = P ( x | HG ) . > Can you elaborate some on this . Well , " P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) " means that x is as likely to be observed if A is operative as it is if B is operative . This implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that A and B are operative ; the difference reduces to the difference between the ( unknown and unhelpful ) prior probabilities P ( A ) and P ( B ): P ( x | A ) = P ( x | B ) = = > P ( A | x ) = k P ( A ) , and P ( B | x ) = k P ( B ) where k = P ( x | A ) / P ( x ) = P ( x | B ) / P ( x ) . So A and B are " equally consistent with the data " in that observing x doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative . In the particular case where A = H and B = HG , however , we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by P ( H ) > = P ( HG ) , although we don't know the actual values , and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to throw out any such HG . > Also , in the " real world " it isn't as clear cut and dry it seems > to me . We can't always determine whether the equality " P ( x | H ) = > P ( x | HG ) " is true . That's certainly true , but the particular point here was whether or not a ` divine component ' actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component , which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of ` spreading the word ' . Now it seems to me , as I've said , that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model , but rather * less * well if one proposes a ` divine component ' in addition , since I would expect the latter to conspire * against * wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs . Thus my * personal * feeling is that P ( x | HG ) isn't even equal to P ( x | H ) in this case , but is smaller ( H is memetic transmission , G is ` divine component ' , x is the variance among beliefs ) . But I happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression . > BTW , my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one - > I checked most of your work and didn't find an error and you seem very > careful so there probably isn't a " math mistake " .

I'm not a Baysian statistician ( nor any type of > statistician ) , so this would be very helpful . Not that I'm a statistician as such either , but : The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the ( read ` my ' ) observations to date . However , theism ( of the type with which I am concerned ) * also * suggests that , for instance , prayer may be answered , people may be miraculously healed ( both are in principle amenable to statistical verification ) and that god / s may generally intervene in measurable ways . This means that these regions of the space of possible observations , which I loosely termed " appearances of god / s " , have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic . Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space , the probability which theism expends on making " appearances of god / s " possible must come from somewhere else ( i . e . other possible observations ) . All else being equal , this means that an observation which * isn't * an " appearance of god / s " must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism . The Bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase , with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis . Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque , but it's rather difficult to put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities , and particularly that the total area under them is always unity . An analogy may ( or may not :-) be helpful . Say that hypothesis A is " the coin is fair " , and that B is " the coin is unfair ( two-headed ) " . ( I've used A and B to avoid confusion with H [ heads ] and T [ tails ] . ) Then P ( H | A ) = 0.5 } total 1 P ( T | A ) = 0.5 } P ( H | B ) = 1 } total 1 P ( T | B ) = 0 } The observations are a string of heads , with no tails . This is compatible with both a fair coin ( A ) and a two-headed coin ( B ) . However , the probability expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails ( even though they don't actually appear ) must come from somewhere else , since the total must be unity , and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads . Say our running estimates at time n - 1 are e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) and e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) . The observation x [ n ] at time n is another head , x [ n ] = H . The estimates are modified according to P ( H | A ) e [ n ] ( A ) = e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) * - - - = e [ n - 1 ] ( A ) * m P ( H ) and P ( H | B ) e [ n ] ( B ) = e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) * - - - = e [ n - 1 ] ( B ) * 2m P ( H ) Now we don't know P ( H ) , the * actual * prior probability of a head , but the multiplier for e ( A ) is half that for e ( B ) . This is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed . Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates , after n heads , we have n e [ n ] ( A ) = m e [ 0 ] ( A ) and n e [ n ] ( B ) = ( 2m ) e [ 0 ] ( B ) , and since e [ k ] ( A ) + e [ k ] ( B ) = 1 at any time k , you can show that 0.5 < m < 1 and thus 1 < 2m < 2 . Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads . The loose analogy is between " unfair coin " and atheism , and between " fair coin " and theism , with observations consistent with both . A tail , which would falsify " unfair coin " , is analogous to an " appearance of god / s " , which would falsify atheism . I am * not * claiming that the analogy extends to the numerical values of the various probabilities , just that the principle is the same . > > Constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them > ^ ^ ^ > > is at all possible under the respective theisms , constantly increases > ^ ^ ^ > > the notional estimated probability that they don't exist , > It's important to draw a distinction between theism that could > be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can't . > Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible , > it doesn't make sense to say " lack of evidence " supports the contrary > view . Quite so , but this type of theism is what I might call " the G in the HG " , in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion , and I'd bin it on those grounds . > So it depends upon your conception of this god .

We don't need , in the above analogy , to know * any * prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity , and that the corresponding multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity . You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates either . It's clear that after a large number of observations , P ( fair-coin ) approaches zero and P ( two-headed-coin ) approaches unity . All you need to know is whether P ( x | Ha ) is larger than P ( x | Ht ) for observed x , and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered * possible * ( not necessary ) under Ht which are not possible under Ha , and all else is equal . > Baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations .

Maybe I'm not > understanding what you mean by " prediction " - could you explain what > you mean by this word ? I'll explain , but bear in mind that this isn't central ; all I require of a theism is that it * not * make the prediction " Appearances of god / s will never happen " , as does atheism . ( Before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn't make this prediction either , the difference is that QM and atheism do not form a partition . ) Predictions include such statements as " Prayer is efficacious " ( implying " If you do the stats , you will find that Prayer is efficacious " ) , or " Prayer is * not * efficacious " , or " Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .

This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin ; even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin , and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify X in the limit .

Right on , Jon ! Who cares who or whose , as long as it works for the individual . But don't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children .

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people . That is it's primary ( and I would argue only ) purpose . To continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility , especially when you know you will be killing innocents , is unconscionable . At the very least , the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society , not their detriments . We are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems . One has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment . Just in case I wasn't clear again : We maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain . Why ?

Well , this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt.atheism , where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system , without resorting to accusing others of bigotry . It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting , since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity . I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race , religion , ethnic background , sex , or other inconsequential characteristics . All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics . Thus , pending further evidence , I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots , and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

The deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with > the demonstrations , or on the demonstrators themselves , if they were > violent . To what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour > against Rushdie ? Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media , the Muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations . For every twenty or so newspaper , magazine articles , interviews etc . supporting Rushdie , there would appear one Muslim voice . This person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was , not on his knowledge of Islam or the situation at the time . This approx . twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis , with Rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment , the valiant defender of everyman's right to free speech decoupled from responsibility . ( As an aside , it's interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up , some books ( defaming certain ethnic and religious groups ) continued to be banned here . It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups . For Muslims this kind of double standard was annoying . ) Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at " organized " Islam , and he did so with admirable verbal skill . The only kind of Islam which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a " secular " Islam - an Islam separated from it's Qur'an , it's Prophet , God , its legislation , and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena . Fine - Rushdie made his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known . The scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was , by this time , already a political situation - affecting governments as well as individuals . The situation was a serious one , with far-reaching political implications . At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie , throwing fuel on the fire - engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution . Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility , has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind , has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down . Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in " boldly " defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work , no matter what insult they find within it . Perhaps you see him as a kind of secular " heroic Knight " , mounted on the his media steed , doing battle with the " dragon " of Islamic " fundamentalism " . Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a Muslim atmosphere , knew well what Muslim's hold dear , who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander , insult , and attack Islam and its most notable personalities - who , when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis , continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media - who , even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation , continued his mischief , instead of having the good sense to desist . Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale , mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged . The deaths of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief even after this , was the triggering factor that seemed to decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief . The person at the centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the continuing mischief - all media support , government support was just that - support . The source was Rushdie ( and his publishers , who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see Rushdie constantly in the media ) . The Islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief making , was applied to Rushdie . > You're attempts at justification are not doing the > image of Islam any good . I have made no attempts at justification , only at explanation . " Image " is the chief concern of Muslim ' apologists ' for Islam and for Rushdie . If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture within a larger secular culture , such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam would then be thought to have a good " image " ( Principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image ) . A " good image " usually means " be more like me " . Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis . > In Iran , the situation was monitored for many > > months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free > > worldwide voice that the media gave him , the situation was monitored > > more seriously .

The fatwa came later - much later . If Rushdie didn't mouth off so much in the media , the fuss would have died down - no one would have been killed , no fatwa would have been passed - the whole episode would have fizzled away .From : bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu ( Bill Conner ) Subject : Re : IF ONLY HE KNEW prudenti@juncol.juniata.edu wrote : : Upon arriving at home , Joseph probably took advantage of Mary ... had his way : with her so to speak .

Once a criminal has committed a murder , his desires are irrelevant . And , you still have not answered my question .

Need I say more ? There is also the question of what is meant by " atheist " . A familiar example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows . The two statements following ARE consistent : ( 1 ) I do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks ( 2 ) I do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks The two statements following are NOT consistent : ( 3 ) I do believe that you are wearing lilac socks ( 4 ) I do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks Statements ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) require no faith , they make no presumptions about the nature of reality . Statements ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) require belief . Many atheists ( myself included ) take the following position : ( 5 ) I do not believe that there is a god . ( 6 ) I do not believe that there is not a god . That is , I harbor no beliefs at all , there is no good evidence for god existing or not . Some folks call this agnosticism .

The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief . I would seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu . First of all , I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail ; it's possible to give succinct answers to most everything , but there's enough here to keep most of you typing for hours , I'm sure . As much detail as you want to give me ( I mean it ) is great , but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of individuals as possible , so even minimal responses are far better than nothing - - it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration . Secondly , I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious ; I know that phrases like " What would convince you of the existence of God " imply that I am a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens . In fact , I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself , so my use of " God " is a question of locution rather than ideology - - it's easier than just repeating " a deity or higher power " every time . Also , I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like " belief system " although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs , but are skeptical towards everything . I understand ; but you know what I mean . Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases required to get the precise idea across . Lastly , thanks ! Please fill out as much as you can , in as much detail as you can , and send them to me . My research and I thank you . - - - Where would you place your beliefs , on the spectrum Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism ? Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs . In what , if any , religious tradition were you raised ? Did you ever believe in the existence of a God ? ( Several of the following questions presume that the answer to this is " yes ; " if you've always been an atheist , or at least never a theist , you may have to modify the question / answer somewhat . ) How serious was your / your family's involvement ? How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe ? How and when did your " final break " with your beliefs , if any , occur ? I realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an " event " per se ; whatever the case , just describe it in whatever detail you wish . What contact with other atheists have you had ; before and after ( and during ) your " conversion " to atheism ? ( Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism counts - - how have net discussions affected your beliefs ? ) To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your beliefs ? Did you come by your beliefs through discussion , through independent means , or by some combination of the two or other means ? Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational means ( proofs of the non-existence of God , etc ) , or was it perhaps , at least in part , through other means ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc ) ? To what extent do you feel you " understand " the universe through your beliefs ? What phenomena of the universe and of human existence ( anything from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs ) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where are they lacking as an explanatory method ? What would it take for you to question , or change , your beliefs ? What would convince you of the existence of God , what would convince you of the plausibility of God's existence , and so forth ? How dynamic are your beliefs - - are they constantly changing ; have they stayed more or less the same for some time ? Are you involved in a career or education in science ? To what extent do you think science has influenced your beliefs ? ( Issac Asimov claimed that science was the new " secular religion , " and that " scientists are , in a very real sense , the new priesthood . " Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi - religious base , or even a religious element ? ) - - - This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals , but also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose ideas and histories could be very useful to me . Would you be willing to have me , on the basis of this survey , write you to find out more about you and your beliefs ?

Mark Abbott mtabbott@unix.amherst.edFrom : acooper@mac.cc.macalstr.edu Subject : Idle questions for fellow atheists I wonder how many atheists out there care to speculate on the face of the world if atheists were the majority rather than the minority group of the population . It is rather a ridiculous question in some ways , I know , but my newsreader is down so I am not getting any new postings for a bit , so I figure I might as well post something new myself . Also , how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking . The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation , so one is not , intrinsically , different from the other , qualitatively . But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere , and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core , than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery ; ie , how it expresses its own selfishness .

STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic . But to do so is absolutely useless now . If you had wanted to get right with God before the rapture , you could have , but you chose to wait . Now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the Tribulation . " But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved . " - Matthew 24:13 II . REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until Christ's second coming . Also know as " the time of Jacob's ( Israel's ) trouble " ( Jere 30:7 ) and " Daniel's Seventieth Week " ( Dan 9 ) , this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror . III . GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community ( the revived Roman Empire ) , Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will be tantamount to treason . The Bible , however , will be your most valuable possession during the Tribulation . IV . READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated , even if you are careful , it is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them . It is especially important to read Daniel , Luke 21 , Matthew 24 , Revelation , and Amos , for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you . V . PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray and pray . Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of Christ . VI . DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED ONES DIE AS MARTYRS After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community , he will institute a world economic system , designed so that you cannot buy , sell , or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name . Money will be useless . " And he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads , and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , or the number of his name . Here is wisdom . Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man : His number is 666 " - Revelation 13:16- 18 . The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity . Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past , such as the Holocaust . [ or maybe the crusades ? - M ] You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's rule ; it will be much worse than anything in history ( Matt 24:21 ) " ... I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held . And a white robe was given to each of them : and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer , until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren , who would be killed as they were , was completed . " Revelation 6:9 , 11 . His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn / " ... And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands . " - Revelation 20:4 . He will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ . Nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you , even your children , torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark . If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image , however , you will be consigned to the second death , which is the Lake of Fire . [ Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash ... - M ] You cannot be redeemed . It is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then [ sic ] to endure eternal torment in the Ring ^ H ^ H ^ H ^ H Lake of Fire . " ... If anyone worships the Beast and his image , and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand , he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of God , which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation . An [ sic ] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb . " - Revelation 14:9- 10 [ and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders ; special hats given to the first 5,000 at the stadium - - M ] VII . SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government until the end of the Tribulation , all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening , since only those who are extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake . The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area , for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least populated areas . Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation . [ " As you can see on the weather map , heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak . Expect delays on I - 95 outbound , and perhaps school closings " - - M ] Store water and food , because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark . Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood . [ Get a good water filter . - - M ] Bring different types of clothing for all seasons , as well as flashlights , batteries , generators , and First Aid supplies . In short , learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did . VIII . TRUST NO ONE There will be secret agents everywhere , spying for the Antichrist's government . Be on the lookout . [ Perot supporters take note - - M ] IX . WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to , for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it . We can infer from Daniel 11 certain characteristics of this man . Popular during the first three and a half years of the Tribulation , he will dominate the airwaves . He will be physically appealing , highly intelligent , with Christ-like charisma and personality . An international politician , military tactician and economic expert , his word will be peace ; he will make a treaty with the Jews , which he will break after three and a half years . He will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed . Even the very elect will be deceived . If you do not pray and read the Bible , you too will be deceived . [ Dominate the airwaves ? Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh ... - M ] The antichrist will have a companion , the False Prohphet [ sic ] , who will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak . All who refuse to worhsip [ sic ] the image will be killed . The final three and a half years will be absolutely insane , with demonized spirits everywhere . X . DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE ! The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of Christ . The Antichrist will be defeated . Be steadfast and endure , and you will be rewarded greatly in Heaven . Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now . The salvation of your sould depends upon it . Determine that , come what may , you will not take the mark or worship the Antichrist . You still have a chance to be saved or remain saved , but this time you will have to be " faithful unto death .

I haven't read Lewis's article , so I can't comment directly upon it , and have only spoken about his writings _in general _ so far , that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam . His anti-Islamic polemics , as I understand it , are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths . Again , read " Orientalism " by Edward Said . I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust , in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book ( it is a well-known book ) and check the evidence out for _yourself_ . > The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES , > when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex . > I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines , I wrote an > incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not > want his concubine to get pregnant etc . , which is contrary > to the notion that " sex is for procreation only " .

I understand your point of view , Selim - - I think , rather , it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ . Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before . Regarding women , I have made posting after posting on this subject , showing that Islam is not anti-woman , etc . However , have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them ? I just reposted a very good one , under the title " Islam and Women " , reposted from soc.religion.islam . If this has already disappeared from your site , then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article . IMHO , your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient . Regarding slaves , _my_ posting on slavery - - the second one I made , which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year - - is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view . Our approaches are different - - you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths . Now , just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action , does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam , even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah ? No ! Of course not . Let me give you a concrete example , which might help clarify this for you . The Qur'an prohibits drinking . Now , if a person says " I am a Muslim " and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer , does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer ? Of course not , and only an idiot would think so . Do you see my point ? > It is very natural to think that > the author / authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic > structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm > shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of > the feudal era and the rise of commerce , second with the industrial > revolution .

In fact , the rise of Islam can easily be modeled > after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home , > but increase your wealth by conquering places . You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms . Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth - - this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings . To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking - - Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist . ( This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market - - for it does in general - - but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it . ) > When this stopped , > you ( and I ) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour . > No capital , no industry , very poor social services - the education > level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world , the health > statistics are miserable etc .. One can postulate numerous reasons for this . Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist , etc . etc . Selim , I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think ( as you obviously do ) that Islam = > lack of education and power . For a large part of history , the Islamic world was very powerful . For a significant section of history , the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences . So to say that Islam is , for example , anti-education is completely absurd . You try to blame this situation on Islam - - history shows that your conclusion is false and that , instead , there must be other reasons for this situation . > You blame Muslims for not following the Quran , but I blame Muslims > for following the Quran . Well , Selim , your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam . I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not . > Your idea is baseless from historical > facts , it is a poor utopia , The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage - - yet somehow , in your theory , it is by " following the Qur'an " that Muslims are backwards in education . Selim , it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical , for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory . > while my ideas are derived from social > and economic history . You have certainly not shown this ; you have merely stated it . So far , it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history . That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this . > My solution to all Muslims is simple : > CUT THE CRAP , I think , Selim , you should consider taking your own advice . > GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT Here too . > AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE > THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE . Selim , you have such conviction of your viewpoint , yet you demonstrate ignorance , not only of Islam but also of Islamic history ( particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think ) . Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history ! Selim , if I remember right , you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam . I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues , and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have .

Thanks for a well put testimonial . Stan Krieger and his kind who think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the only acceptable position in scouting should take notice . The BSA has been hijacked by the religious right , but some of the core values have survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts haven't given up .

But it rather depends on what the ' certain circumstances ' are . When you talk about Christianity , or Islam , then at least your claims can be understood .

Yes , but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity .

Okay , so this is what you call murder . But , the question is whether or not all such " murders " are wrong .

Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution . And , every member of society shares this blame .

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not .

Yes , while we could objectively determine the difference ( if we knew all possible information ) , we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system . I think that our system is almost as good as possible , but it still isn't objectively perfect . You see , it doesn't matter if we * know * it is fair or not .

Some schools in Missouri that were on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day . Many people evacuated New Madrid and other towns in teh are . I wouldn't be suprised if there were more journalists in the area than residents . Of course , teh earthquake never occured . HOw do I know about his ?

I think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how deviant the view _as I've articulated it above _ ( which may not be the true view of Khomeini ) is from the basic principles of Islam . So that the non-muslim readers of this group will see how far from the simple basics of Islam such views are on the face of them . And if they are _not_ in contradiction with the basics of Islam , how subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in Islam while they are explicitly proscribed by the Qur'an . > The topic is deeply embedded in the world view of Islam and the > esoteric teachings of the Prophet ( S .

I would be interested in discussing this privately and I am interested in hearing how one might try to make the concept of error-free and sinless human beings philosophically consistent with the teachings of the Qur'an .

" Jesus Christ never commanded toleration as a motive for His disciples , and toleration is the antithesis of the Christian message . " Page 30 . " The central dynamic of the Freemason drive for world unity through fraternity , liberty and equality is toleration . This is seen in the writings of the ' great ' writers of Freemasonry " .

" What seems so right in the interest of toleration and its cousins-liberty , equality and fraternity-is actually one of the subtlest lies of the ' father of lies . ' " Page 40 . " The Southern Baptist Convention has many churches which were founded in the Lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the Lodge .

   ... a belief ... whose truth is accepted uncritically . " ) How does that qualify ? Indeed , it's almost oxymoronic ... a rather amusing instance . I've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist-views as " accepted uncritically , " especially the few that are legend . Many are trying to explain basic truths , as myths do , but they don't meet the other criterions . Also ... > Divine justice .

Those that > claim that there is no evidence for the existence of God or that His will is > unknown , must deliberately ignore the Bible ; the ignorance itself is > no excuse . 1 ) No , they don't have to ignore the Bible . The Bible is far from universally accepted . The Bible is NOT a proof of god ; it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god . ( Or does it prove even that ? They might have been writing it as series of fiction short-stories . As in the case of Dionetics . ) Assuming the writers believed it , the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it . And that's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and Biblical-philosophers were correct . 2 ) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible . 3 ) Again , read the FAQ . > freedom . You are free to ignore God in the same way you are free to > ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known > in both cases . That an atheist can't accept the evidence means only Bzzt ... wrong answer ! Gravity is directly THERE . It doesn't stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it .

Human reason > always comes back to the question of God , in every generation and in No , human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of " God " ; it has usually come back to the existance of " god " . In other words , it doesn't generally come back to the xtian god , it comes back to whether there is any god . And , in much of oriental philosophic history , it generally doesn't pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there .

McElwaine , Physicist Ninety to a hundred years ago , everybody " knew " that a heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly . It would violate the " laws " of physics . All of the " experts " and " authorities " said so . For example , Simon Newcomb declared in 1901 : " The demonstration that no possible combination of known substances , known forms of machinery and known forms of force , can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air , seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be . " Fortunately , a few SMART people such as the Wright Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final word . Now we take airplanes for granted , ( except when they crash ) . Today , orthodox physicists and other " scientists " are saying similar things against several kinds of ' Free Energy ' Technologies , using negative terms such as " pseudo-science " and " perpetual motion " , and citing so-called " laws " which assert that " energy cannot be created or destroyed " ( " 1st law of thermodynamics " ) and " there is always a decrease in useful energy " ( " 2nd law of thermodynamics " ) . The physicists do not know how to do certain things , so they ARROGANTLY declare that those things cannot be done . Such PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern " science " and help to cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox modern theories . Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe , with - OUT burning any kind of fuel , making them the PERFECT SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated pollution , degradation , and depletion of the environment . Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy , but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by various forms of induction . UNLIKE solar or wind devices , they need little or no energy storage capacity , because they can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed . Solar energy has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds , trees , buildings , or the earth itself , or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes . Likewise , wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and often non-existent . Neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes . Properly designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations . For example , at least three U . S . patents ( # 3,811 , 058 , # 3,879 , 622 , and # 4,151 , 431 ) have so far been awarded for motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS , seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic field . The first two require a feedback network in order to be self-running . The third one , as described in detail in " Science & Mechanics " magazine , Spring 1980 , ( " Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor " , by Jorma Hyypia , pages 45-48 , 114-117 , and front cover ) , requires critical sizes , shapes , orientations , and spacings of magnets , but NO feedback . Such a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible heatpump in one's home , YEAR ROUND , FOR FREE . [ Complete descriptive copies of U . S . patents are $ 3.00 each from the U . S . Patent Office , 2021 Jefferson Davis Hwy . , Arlington , VA 22202 ; correct 7 - digit patent number required . Or try getting copies of BOTH the article AND the Patents via your local public or university library's inter-library loan dept .. ] A second type of free-energy device , such as the ' Gray Motor ' ( U . S . Patent # 3,890 , 548 ) , the ' Tesla Coil ' , and the motor of inventor Joseph Newman [ see SCIENCE , 2-10- 84 , pages 571-2 . ] , taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from ' EARTH RESONANCE ' ( about 12 cycles per second plus harmonics ) . They typically have a ' SPARK GAP ' in the circuit which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped . It is important that the total ' inductance ' and ' capacitance ' of the Device combine to ' RESONATE ' at the same frequency as ' EARTH RESONANCE ' in order to maximize the power output . This output can also be increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the ' NEUTRAL CENTER ' of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet . In the case of a Tesla Coil , slipping a ' TOROID CHOKE COIL ' around the secondary coil will enhance output power . [ " Earth Energy : Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems " , by John Bigelow , 1976 , Health Research , P . O . Box 70 , Mokelumne Hill , CA 95245 . ] During the 1930 ' s , an Austrian civil engineer named Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an ' IMPLOSION TURBINE ' ( German name , ' ZOKWENDLE ' ) , after analyzing erosion , and lack of erosion , in differently shaped waterways , and developing sophisticated mathematical equations to explain it . As described in the book " A Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources " , by Dan A . Davidson , 1977 , water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a CRITICAL VELOCITY . The water then IMPLODES , no longer touching the inside walls of the tubing , and drives the pump , which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC GENERATOR . The device seems to be tapping energy from that of the earth's rotation , via the ' Coriolis effect ' , LIKE A TORNADO . [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY ! ] A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the ' McClintock Air Motor ' ( U . S . Patent # 2,982 , 261 ) , which is a cross between a diesel engine ( it has three cylinders with a compression ratio of 27 to 1 ) and a rotary engine ( with solar and planetary gears ) . It burns NO FUEL , but becomes self-running by driving its own air compressor . This engine also generates a lot of heat , which could be used to heat buildings ; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large trucks , preventing their slowing down when climbing hills . [ David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the automatic transmission , differential , and 4 - wheel drive . ] Crystals may someday be used to supply energy , as shown in the Star Trek shows , perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector . One other energy source should be mentioned here , despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free Energy . A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION reactor which he calls ' Migma ' , which uses NON-radioactive deuterium as a fuel [ available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities from sea water ] , does NOT produce radioactive waste , can be converted DIRECTLY into electricity ( with-OUT energy-wasting steam turbines ) , and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city . And UNLIKE the " Tokamaks " and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about , Migma WORKS , already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in . [ " New Times " ( U . S . version ) , 6-26- 78 , pages 32-40 . ] And then there are the ' cold fusion ' experiments that have been in the news lately , originally conducted by University of Utah researchers B . Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann . Some U . S . Navy researchers at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center in California , under the direction of chemist Melvin Miles , finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus , had them analyzed with mass-spectrometry techniques , and found HELIUM 4 , which PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place , and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated . There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called " laws " of thermodynamics are NOT so " absolute " . For example , the late Physicist Dewey B . Larson developed a comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe , which he calls the ' Reciprocal System ' , ( which he describes in detail in several books such as " Nothing But Motion " ( 1979 ) and " The Universe of Motion " ( 1984 ) ) , in which the physical universe has TWO DISTINCT HALVES , the material half and an anti-matter half , with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing between them , with-OUT the " heat death " predicted by thermodynamic " laws " . His Theory explains the universe MUCH BETTER than modern orthodox theories , including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about , and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way . Some Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow , seemingly converting " low-quality energy " into " high-quality energy " . Also , certain religious organizations such as ' Sant Mat ' and ' Eckankar ' teach their Members that the physical universe is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of existence , like parallel universes , or analogous to TV channels , as described in books like " The Path of the Masters " , by Dr . Julian Johnson , 1939 , and " Eckankar : The Key to Secret Worlds " , by Sri Paul Twitchell , 1969 . For example , the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the ' Astral Plane ' . Long-time Members of these groups have learned to ' Soul Travel ' into these higher worlds and report on conditions there . It seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe , or be created at the boundary between them , given the right configuration of matter to channel it . This is supported by many successful laboratory-controlled experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world , such as those described in the book " Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain " . In terms of economics , the market has FAILED . Inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment , and the conventional energy producer $ have no desire to do so because of their VE $ TED INTERE $ T $ . The government is needed to intervene . If the government does not intervene , then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out , prices for energy will increase , and pollution and its harmful effects ( including the ' GREENHOUSE EFFECT ' , acid rain , smog , radioactive contamination , oil spills , rape of the land by strip mining , etc . ) will continue to increase . The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development of Free Energy by Inventors and universities , subsidize private production ( until the producers can make it on their own ) , and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of Free Energy Hardware . The long-range effects of such government intervention would be wide-spread and profound . The quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer $ ( coal mining companie $ , oil companie $ and countries , electric utilitie $ , etc . ) would drop to near zero , forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere . Energy resources ( coal , uranium , oil , and gas ) would be left in the ground . Prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero , while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases ( as happened with VCR's , personal computers , etc . ) . Costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease , along with their prices to consumers . Consumers would be able to realize the " opportunity costs " of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel . Tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars . Government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way . AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR . Many conventional energy producer $ would go out of business , but society as a whole , and the earth's environment and ecosystems , would benefit greatly . It is the People , that government should serve , rather than the big corporation $ and bank $ .

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you phrase the question makes it unanswerable . The concepts of " right " and " wrong " ( or " correct / incorrect " or " true / false " ) belong to the domain of epistemological rather than moral questions . It makes no sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is legitimate to ask if it is good ( or better than another position ) . Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives of epistemology and ethics : perception and motivation , respectively . One can certainly ask if a percept is " right " ( correct , true , veridical ) or " wrong " ( incorrect , false , illusory ) . But it makes little sense to ask if a motive is true or false . On the other hand , it is strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can certainly ask that question about motives . Therefore , your suggested answers ( a ) - ( c ) simply can't be considered : they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment . Now the problem with ( d ) is that it is double-barrelled : I agree with the first part ( that the " rightness " of a moral position is a meaningless question ) , for the reasons stated above . But that is irrelevant to the alleged implication ( not an implication at all ) that one cannot feel peace is better than war . I certainly can make value judgments ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the " correctness " of the position . Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of ( a ) - ( d ) . My short ( e ) answer is that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue , neither is right ( correct ) or wrong ( incorrect ) . They simply hold different moral values ( feelings ) . - - - John A .

Do you mean by " omnipotent " that God should be able to do anything / everything ? This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless . To be descriptive , omnipotence must mean " being all-powerful " and not " being able to do anything / everything " . Let me illustrate by analogy . Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth . Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations . The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit . The US would be militarily " omnipotent " . But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine / philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation , such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states . Technically ( in this scenario ) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess . But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference . If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough , then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated . Effectively , the US would be limited in what it could actually do , although it had the power to do " whatever it wanted " . The US would simply " never want to interfere " for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy . God is effectively limited in the same sense . He is all powerful , but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He , Himself is . I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence .

I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians " Creation Science " on any topic . It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran , to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded . It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then " interpret " passages to match those findings . People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time .

For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no faith at all . You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render that possibilty of no interest . It is a very different thing to say that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to think about . It's not either or . Sometimes is just something else more interesting that occupies your mind . I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily applied to god and religion . It takes both faith and dogma to expect the sun to come up every morning , but there is overwhelming reason every single day , day in and day out , for _everyone_ to put his faith and dogma there .

It does no one any good to deny it . > It only makes the more reasonable Muslims look like they are protecting the > bad ones . Can you see that ? I don't deny this fact . The thrust of my argument here is that ( a ) Salameh is , according to US law , innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law . As his guilt has not been established , it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption . ( b ) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents . If Muslims - - who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this - - perform such actions , it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam , but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of Islam . This is an important distinction . I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say " Muslim " . In general , anyone who calls themselves a " Muslim " and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim . Thus , one who might do things contrary to Islam ( through ignorance , for example ) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim . If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles , though , then one does leave Islam . The term " Muslim " is to be contrasted with " Mu'min " , which means " true believer " . However , whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God ( and perhaps that person himself ) . So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism , because it is not known to anybody ( except myself and God ) , whether I , for example , am a " true believer " or not . For example , I could just be putting on a show here , and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here , without anyone knowing . Thus , when we say " Muslims " we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam , whether in practice they might , in ignorance , transgress Islamic teachings . By " Muslim " we do not necessarily mean " Mu'min " , or " true believer " in Islam .

Correct me if I am wrong , but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews .

Either there is some connection between the text , the fact that it exists , and your interpretation of it , or it is purely arbitrary .. Further , the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better . You might answer that one can't becuase some peculiar Biblical information might be lost , but that holds true of every other book , and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place ?

And the argument you have given is a fallacy , while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not , it can be crucial in other questions . Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way , and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god . One cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question . BenediktFrom : kmr4@po.CWRU.edu ( Keith M .

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism ; I think many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ . Your generalisms are then misplaced - - atheism needn't imply materialism , or the lack of an absolute moral system . However , I do tend to materialism and don't believe in absolute morality , so I'll answer your questions . > How then can an atheist judge value ? An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does : according to a personal understanding of morality . That I don't believe in an absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one . I'm just explicit , as in the line of postings you followed up , that when I express judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad . My moral code is not particular different from that of others around me , be they Christians , Muslims , or atheists . So when I say that I object to genocide , I'm not expressing anything particularly out of line with what my society holds . If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it does , my answer would be mechanistic to your taste - - that a moral code is a prerequisite for a functioning society , and that humanity probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of our ability to exist in large societies , thereby achieving considerable survival advantages . You'd probably say that God just made the rules . Neither of us can convince the other , but we share a common understanding about many moral issues . You think you get it from your religion , I think I get it ( and you get it ) from early childhood teaching . > That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God > or God's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your > nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled > with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction . I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books , but in prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're saying . I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as " God commanded the genocide of the Canaanites " is mechanistic , but of course I think that's true of you as well . My reaction has little to do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does , but if a god existed who commanded genocide , I could not consider him good , which is supposedly an attribute of God . > All of this being so , you have excluded > yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , > etc . and cannot participate . Your opinion about the Bible can have no > weight whatsoever . Hmm . Yes , I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good . I have as much place discussing values etc . as any other person . In fact , I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion , by framing the questions in terms of reason : for instance , it is clear that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands , then the quality of life will be generally poor , so a system that fosters coexistence is superior , if quality of life is an agreed goal . An absolutist , on the other hand , can only thump those portions of a Bible they happen to agree with , and say " this is good " , even if the act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in the discussion . The attempt to define someone or a group of people as " excluded from discussion " , such that they " cannot participate " , and their opinions given " no weight whatsoever " is the lowest form or reasoning ( ad hominem / poisoning the well ) , and presumably the resort of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right , wrong , and the Bible . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .

M . can have his " temporary atheists " whenever he needs them and all the " temporary atheists " can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam . Temporary atheism , temporary Islam , temporary marriage . None of it sticks . A teflon religion . How convenient . And so easy to clean up after .

I take it that you're expressing skepticism at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced the Constitution of the people who stole their continent . You could be right , but it sounds plausible to me . Is there any reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand ? Here's some more : Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid - 1700s Indians were not only invited to participate in the deliberations of our " founding fathers , " but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany Plan of Union , and later the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution . That this would be absent from our school texts , and from history , and from media is not surprising given the devotion Americans feel to our founding myth : Great men gathered to express a new vision that has withstood the test of time . If it were revealed that Indians had a role in it , imagine the blow to the American psyche .
   ... By 1754 , when most of these men and others gathered to creat the Albany Plan of Union , the first try at confederation , they invited forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors on confederate structures . Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at Albany Congress : " It would be a strange thing ... if six nations of ignorant savages [ sic ] should be capable of forming such a union and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted for ages and appears indissoluble , and yet that a like union should be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies . " According to Grinde , Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs and congressional delegates in order to " hammer out a plan that he acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy . " Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde , Jr . , of the University of California at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the American Nation _ addresses this issue . - - Doug Graham dgraham@bnr.ca My opinions are my own .From : danb@shell.portal.com ( Dan E Babcock ) Subject : Re : some thoughts .

Well , I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key ( the motto can be attributed to him ) , but it is at least clear that he believed in a god .

That is to say , the religion of this country , and the non-religion of the USSR . That was what most of those quotes were about , and some included all atheists , in general , as well .

I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we take the appellation ` Rabbi ' seriously then Jesus had a full grasp of contemporary ` scripture ' Mat 21:42 Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures ... Mat 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing Mat 22:29 the scriptures , nor the power of God . Following from this , he would have been in a wonderful position to fulfil prophesies , and the NT says as much : Mat 26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , Mat 26:54 that thus it must be ? Mat 26:56 But all this was done , that the scriptures of the Mat 26:56 prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples Mat 26:56 forsook him , and fled . If the books comprising the referred-to ` scripture ' had not been accessible then it probably would be a different matter . - - tonyFrom : healta@saturn.wwc.edu ( Tammy R Healy ) Subject : Re : free moral agency In article <11810@vice.ICO.TEK.COM> bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM ( Robert Beauchaine ) writes : > From : bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM ( Robert Beauchaine ) > Subject : Re : free moral agency > Date : 14 Apr 93 21:41 : 31 GMT > In article <healta.133.734810202@saturn.wwc.edu> healta@saturn.wwc.edu ( TAMMY R HEALY ) writes : > > > > > In the Old testement , Satan is RARELY mentioned , if at all . > > > Huh ?

For one , your claim that everyone senses it #is not founded , and you have been asked to give evidence for it often . #And then , the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it #is there unless evidence against it has been found . I have no problem with the second statement . I have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey , and was offered by some other people too : essentially , that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as Freedom . It's a good point , and I'm thinking about it . # #Your trick is to say , I feel A is not right , and so do many I know , #therefore A is absolutely right . It neglects the possibility that #these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process , #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject #of that process . In other words , refutes it . You make the ontological #claim , you have to prove it . Nonsense . My " trick " is to say : I feel that A is better than B and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . Best evidence is therefore that A really is better than B , subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B , and that the resulting system of values is self-consistent . Now get this : " really is better " is an idealisation , a fictional model , in the same sense that " real material existence " is a fictional model . It may or may not correspond to something true . It is nonetheless a useful _assumption_ . Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist " trick " , to wit : I feel that A is better than B , and so does almost any disinterested person I ask . However , if even one person disagrees that A is better than B , or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B , then it is the case that B is better than A for that person , and nothing more can be said . I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise B ( e . g . a terrorist ) . To do that would be to claim that a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist's - which would , of course , be true , but a no-no for an ethical relativist . To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words , and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion . # > #For a similar argument , I sense morality is subjective , it does not # > #hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by # > #others . # > # > If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively # > wrong , and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this # > is possible .

The term god is used in a different way usually . When you use a different definition it is your thing , but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist , it is existence itself , so I say it does not exist . Interestingly , there are those who say that " existence exists " is one of the indubitable statements possible . Further , saying god is existence is either a waste of time , existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god , or you are implying more with it , in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete , making it a fallacy .

" , reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report . Gillow , who had secretly studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair , first approached the scientific community with his theory in the late 1950 ' s . " The whole hat thing , that was just a cover up . The Vatican didn't want the Catholic Community ( tm ) to realize their leader was hefting nearly 8 kilograms of extraneous bone tissue on the top of his skull . " , notes Gillow in his report . " There are whole laboratories in the Vatican that experiment with tissue transplants and bone marrow experiments . What started as a genetic fluke in the mid 1400 ' s is now scientifically engineered and bred for . The whole bone transplant idea started in the mid sixties inspired by doctor Timothy Leary transplanting deer bone cells into small white rats . " Gillow is quick to point out the assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr . Leary from the public eye . " When it becomes time to replace the pope " , says Gillow , " The old pope and the replacement pope are locked in a padded chamber .

For one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon . Unlike a football . Further , you conveniently ignore here that there are many who would not agree on tghe morality of something . The analogy does not hold . One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees with a set of morals YOU have to give . Further , the above is evidence , not proof . Proof would evolve out of testing your theory of absolute morals against competing theories . The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer the objections . Evidence that you are a preacher .

People -> gathered around him and kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing -> someone who was or had been healed . Call me a fool , but I believe he did -> heal people . Logic alert - argument from incredulity . Just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn't mean that it isn't true . Liars can be very pursuasive , just look at Koresh that you yourself site . He has followers that don't think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die . By not giving up after getting shot himself , Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes . As far as healing goes . If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels . In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today . Seems to me that the early gospels weren't that compeling , so the stories got bigger to appeal better . -> Niether was he a lunatic . Would more than an entire nation be drawn -> to someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous .

Or might not have existed , or any number of things . That is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into . There are bifurcations ( or tri , quad , etc ) that are valid , because in the proceeding steps , the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible . Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are , then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent , and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives . However , if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive , then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid , even if the true choice is one of the original choices . I have given at least one valid alternative , so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn't one of the other two alternative is no longer valid . -> Some other things to note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in -> the psalms , Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone . This in his betrayal -> and Crucifixion .

One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom . # # The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem # > that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem # > to agree that some level of interference is necessary . # #They see the need for a " justice " system .

Wishy - > washy statements are not scientific . Note that " ( the celestial bodies ) " in the above verse is an interpolation ( which is why it is in brackets ) - - it is the translator's ( incorrect , IMHO ) interpretation . Here is Maurice Bucaille's translation ( he studied Arabic for his research into the Qur'an and science ) of this verse : " ( God is ) the One Who created the night , the day , the sun and the moon . Each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion . " ( Qur'an : 33 ) The positive aspect of this verse noted by Dr . Maurice Bucaille is that while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time ( and for a long time afterwards ) , there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse ( or anywhere in the Qur'an ) .

Atheists and agnostics , I would imagine , but yes , that was my point .

Ideally , this is true . In reality , though , you have to acknowledge that scientists are human . Scientists have egos and biases . Some scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof for the theory .

Not really . I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco crisis ( $ 7,500 , 000 I believe ) , especially considering the outcome . My point was that mass suicides in the U . S . are rare ( Jonestown was in Guyana , incidentally , although we footed the bill for the clean-up ) , and the U . S . has far more important issues to address . Compare the number of U .

Thus while I believe that no gods exist , this does ^ ^ ^ > not imply * faith * on my part that it is so . ^ ^ ^ Let me first say that " to believe that no gods exist " is in fact different than " not believing in a god or gods " . I will argue that your latter statement , " I believe that no gods exist " does rest upon faith - that is , if you are making a POSITIVE statement that " no gods exist " ( strong atheism ) rather than merely saying I don't know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then ( weak atheism ) . Once again , to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist . I still maintain the position , even after reading the FAQs , that strong atheism requires faith . But first let me say the following . We might have a language problem here - in regards to " faith " and " existence " . I , as a Christian , maintain that God does not exist . To exist means to have being in space and time . God does not HAVE being - God IS Being . Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist , He is eternal . With this said , I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called " existence " of God - and that is not what I'm doing here . I believe that God is the source and ground of being . When you say that " god does not exist " , I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it . However , in what follows I will use the phrase " the existence of God " in it's ' usual sense ' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it . I would like a clarification upon what you mean by " the existence of God " . We also might differ upon what it means to have faith . Here is what Webster says : faith 1a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b ( 1 ): fidelity to one's promises ( 2 ): sincerity of intentions 2a ( 1 ): belief and trust in and loyalty to God ( 2 ): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b ( 1 ): firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^ ^ ^ ( 2 ): complete trust 3 : something that is believed esp . with strong conviction ; esp : a system ^ ^ ^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF One can never prove that God does or does not exist . When you say that you believe God does not exist , and that this is an opinion " based upon observation " , I will have to ask " what observtions are you refering to ? " There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief . All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to ( by predisposed I mean , for example , people whoes partents " believe in God " also tend to ) . To actually draw a conclusion about the " existence " or " non-existence " of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say " I believe that God does / does not exist " . Personally , I think that both statements are misguided . Arguing over the " existence " of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him ( and yes , I use " Him " because a personal God is the only viable concept ( IMO ) - if a person wants to use " She " go ahead . Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise . If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to . ) And please , if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling . If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs , or if they they think I have not read them well enough , just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation .

An interesting question would be if atoms > are objects ( classical ) or phenomenon ( neo-quantum ) or what ? I've been following this train of talk , and the question of dismissing atoms as being in some sense " not real " leaves me uneasy . It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects , and therefore the underlying thing is not necessarily real . The tree outside my window is in this category ... is observe the light which bounces off of it , not the tree itself . The observation is indirect , but no more so than observations I have made of atoms . Also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done with individual atoms . I am thinking in particular of atom trapping experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time . Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying either . One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid technical background in the field . What I read seemed a little confused a quite a red herring . Anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it worked .

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights , is a complete lie and deception , as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving . Liberty is never free , it is always purchased at some cost , almost always at the cost to another . Whos liberty is more inalienable ? Similarly for right of life . When one person must die if he is to save another , or even a group of others , whos life is more inalienable ? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty , especially for serial killers . Whos life and liberty is more valuable , the serial killer , or the victim ? According to that beautiful line , those two rights should be completely inviolate , that is , noone should be able to remove them . This _includes_ government . Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and / or liberty , but is not his own life / liberty inviolate also ?

Assuming you are presenting it accurately , I don't see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion . The material in John ( I'm not sure exactly what is referred to here , but I'll take for granted the similarity to the Matt . / Luke " Q " material ) IS different ; hence , one could have almost any relationship between the two , right up to John getting it straight from Jesus ' mouth . > We are talking date of texts here , not the age of the authors .

It depends on how he defines God . The way I understand the meaning of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science . Ideas drawn from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations drawn from them . Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within science to make them more reconcilable , and especially subserviant in a basic way , to religious dogma . This pursuit always fails . > I think I got his point - - I can quote the section if I'm being vague . > The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates .

Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way . It gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits . Science and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional answers , at best . Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful questions . More questions can be posed than it can answer . At the basis of sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve in contradiction .

You got me thinking now ! This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a move in society to classify previously " socially unacceptable " yet legal activities as OK . In the past it seems to me there were always two coexisting methods of social control . First ( and most explicit ) is legal control . That is the set of actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set of punishments . Secondly ( and somewhat more hidden ) is social control . These are the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered by legal control , are scrictly controled by social censure . Ideally ( if socialization is working as it should ) legal control is hardly ever needed since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of social censure . The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as " guilt " and " morality " . I've heard it said ( and fully believe ) that if it weren't for the VAST majority of people policing themselves , legal control would be absolutely impossible . Lately ( last 50 , 100 years ? ) however there has been a move to attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control ( ie . if it ain't illegal , then don't pick on me ) . I'm not saying this is wrong , merely that it is a byproduct of a society which has : 1 ) A high education level , 2 ) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media , 3 ) A high level of institutionalized individual rights , and 4 ) A " me " oriented culture . I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition , here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can \ can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness , yet we are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as those freedoms don't impinge on another's . IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here . While we appreciate and persue individual rights ( these satisfy the old territoriality and dominance instincts ) , the removal of socialized , inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the continued destabilization of society . I got no quick fix . I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this mess . I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms in order to " stabilize " society . Yet I believe development of societies follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability . Can we find a social model which maximizes indiv . freed . ' s yet is stable ? Perhaps it is possible to live with a " non-stable " society ? Anybody see a way out ? Comments ? PS . Therefore answer to question # 3 : We don't . Do we want to ?

King ( king@ctron.com ) posts a whopping one liner : * " The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be * * treated as a matter of faith . " - - Francis Hitching * I have a few points to make about the above posting . 1 . Science is not based on and does not consist of " quotes " from either real or alleged experts . Critical reasoning , evidence and ( if possible ) experimentation are necessary . Creationists frequently display a massive confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike ( some of the latter quotes are in fact false ) and steadfastly refusing to follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure . This strongly suggests that ( a . ) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and ( b . ) they are aware of this fatal deficiency . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 2 . You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his statement . Why is that ? If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology . Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate scientists . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 3 . Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of " the modern theory of evolution " would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one line quote from an unidentified nobody . It is also important to note that disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid . Creationists seem rather fond of diving ( head first ) into this logical fallacy . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent . 4 . Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack on evolution ( either the fact or the theory ) really represents an attack on science . While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve ( B ^ ) the fact of evolution will not ever go away . Creationists lost the battle long ago ( more than 100 years in fact ) but are simply too willfully ignorant and irrational to acknowledge the fact . Of course , you may not actually be a creationist and you may not really be that ignorant . Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub ( kv07@IASTATE.EDU ) asks : * Neither I , nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings . Who is he ? * I , like Hitchings , am not to be found in Webster's B ^ ) . Francis Hitchings is a scientifically illiterate creationist ( or perhaps he is just playing the part of one ) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ( " The Neck of the Giraffe " ) . In that publication he quotes a creationist ( Jean Sloat Morton ) using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could not have formed by chance . Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution ( the two are quite independent ) but also concluding with a " non sequitur " ( i . e . the conclusion " does not follow " ) . [ pp 70-71 ] Hitchings also misquotes Richard Lewontin in an effort to support creationism . [ pp 84 ] Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber in the Los Angeles Times ( and repeated in the Oregonian ) . The article was titled " ` Giraffe ' sticks scientific neck out too far " . Excerpts include : " Francis Hitchings is not a biologist . " " He goes after Darwin like Mark Antony after Brutus . He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman . " " He suggests a mystical ` organizing principle ' of life , using the similarity of organs in different creatures as evidence [ sic ] . " Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not against it . If John E . King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't surprise me much . It's also interesting that King had nothing to add ( i . e . he only posted a quote ) .

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex - - one which I personally believe has some truth . My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex . At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that , just that it is plausible . To try to convince you all of this particular point of view , I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field , etc . , in order to gather further evidence , which I simply do not have time to do now . Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is " a prime cause " ( in my opinion ) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems , especially depression , in Western societies . I am not saying it is " the prime cause " or " the only cause " , just " a prime cause " - - i . e . one of the significant contributions to this trend . I think when you say you think my view is simplistic , you have forgotten this - - I admit that there are probably other factors , but I do think that extra-marital sex ( and , IMO , subsequent destabilization of the family ) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century .

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man ' s Religions _ by John B . Noss . It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing . It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading . It doesn't " compare " religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities . But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based . In fact , Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages . The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began ( India , East Asia , Near East ) . There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs , Mayas , Incas , etc . Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays . And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way . If you like the old stuff , then a couple of books called " The Ancient Near East " by James B . Pritchard are pretty cool . Got the Epic of Gilgamesh , Code of Hammurabi , all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods were men .

Actually , it is simple . A person P has committed a crime C in country X if P was within the borders of X at the time when C was committed . It doesn't matter if the physical manifestation of C is outside X . For instance , if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their files , I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom . If the US authorities wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law , they have no automatic right to do so . This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites in Holland . Holland had no anti-cracking legislation , and so it was viewed as a " hacker haven " by some US system administrators . Similarly , a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain . If they were broadcasting in Britain , they would be committing a crime .

That's right , and this is pretty impossible , right ? It would be ideal if we could believe for a while , just to try out religion , and only then determine which course of thought suits us best . But again , this is not possible . Not that religion warrants belief , but the belief carries with it some psychological benefits . There are also some psychological burdens , too . > When you speak of " experiencing racism " , do you mean that someone should > believe in racism , or that they should have racist things done to them ?

Well , if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism , they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually " believing " in racism . Of course , the parallel happens to be a poor one , but you originated it . keithFrom : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Re : Christian Morality is In article <pww-210493010443@spac-at1-59.rice.edu> , pww@spacsun.rice.edu ( Peter > > Simple logic arguments are folly .

I looked back at this , and asked some questions of various people and got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed . The US has not sold Iraq any arms . Their navy is entirely made of F-USSR vessels . Their airforce ( not including stuff captured from Kuwait which I am not as sure about ) , doesn't include any US equipment . Their missiles are all non-US . Their tanks are almost all soviet , with about 100 French tanks ( older ones ) . The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal is a few M113s . Those were not sold to Iraq . Iraq captured them from other countries ( like Kuwait ) . Information is hard to prove . You are claiming that the US sold information ? Prove it . Now , how did the US build up Iraq again ? I just gave some fairly conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq . Information is hard to prove , almost certainly if the US did sell information , then that fact is classified , and you can't prove it . If you can provide some useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq , I am very interested , but not if you just make claims based on what " everyone knows " . - - * * * * mccullou@whipple.cs.wisc.edu * Never program and drink beer at the same * * M ^ 2 * time .

What are your thoughts on it ? I read it when it first came out , and the controversy broke . Put my name on the waiting list at the library ( that way if the book was really offensive , none of my money would find its way to the author or publisher ) , and read it , " cover to cover " ( to use a phrase that seems popular here right now ) . And I * liked * it . The writing style was a little hard to get used to , but it was well worth the effort . Coming from a similar background ( Rushdie grew up in Bombay in a muslim family , and moved to England ; I grew up in New Delhi ) , it made a strong impression on me . ( And he used many of the strange constructions of Indian English : the " yaar " at the end of a sentence , " Butbutbut , " the occasional hindi phrase , etc . ) At the time I still " sorta-kinda " thought of myself as a muslim , and I couldn't see what the flap was all about . It seemed clear to me that this was allegory . It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives , and had not ( as my grandfather thundered ) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes ; in short , every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to have missed the point completely . ( And I won't mention the fact that the most militant of them had never even seen the book . Oops , I just did ! ) Perhaps in a deep sense , the book is insulting to Islam , because it exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity need an agent ? She can come directly to me , can't she ? How do we know that Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something ? And how do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up , or put in their own little verses ? And why can Muhammed marry more than four women , when no other muslim is allowed to ? ( Although I think the biggest insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say-so of some " holy " guy . Not to mention murder the author . ) > Over the years , when I have made this point , various primarily muslim > posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book > and had called it such things as " filth and lies " , " I would rank > Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse " , and so on . I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book . A really silly argument - after all , how many of these same people have read " Mein Kampf ? " It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of ? Why don't they just read the book and decide for themselves ?

BBCI was an example of an Islamically owned and operated bank - what will someone bet me they weren't " real " Islamic owners and operators ? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often quite naive depositors . And why did these naive depositors put their life savings into BCCI rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down the street ?

I've been thinking about this every now and then since I cut my ties with Christianity . It is surprising to note that a large majority of people , at least in Finland , seem to be apatheists - even though 90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland , religious people are actually a minority . Could it be possible that many people believe in god " just in case " ? It seems people do not want to seek the truth ; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments . A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly . The majority doesn't care - it believes , but doesn't know what or how . People don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle , they only want to keep the virtual gate open . A Christian would say that they are not " born in the Spirit " , but this does not disturb them . Religion is not something to think about . I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream . Religions have a strong appeal to people , nevertheless - a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to . Coupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our morality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop , too many people take the poison with a smile .

Right . Unfortunately for you , it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that I condemned the bombing of Dresden too . I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy , too .

As I understand it , that is not the case ; we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the German people . > civilians suffer .
