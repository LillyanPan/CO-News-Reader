I bought it in California , and if it'll let me , I'd like to keep it for another year . The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work . The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents . Right now it is stuck in the " vent " mode . It will blow warm air , but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor ( I can live without this ) or the defrost ( I can't live without this ) . I probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position , but this blows a lot of air in my face and is , well , kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse . I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem ( or part of it ) is with the two diaphragms which control up / down and outside / inside air flow . THe diaphragm which controls outside ( vent ) / in - side ( no vent ) air is cracked most of the way around , and the other one is probably damaged too , considering the advanced age of the car . Two questions : 1 ) Is there anything I should be aware of about this ( other than the fact that I should move from Indiana ) ? 2 ) In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available , is there a way to " fix " this ?

The odometer has rolled over , but we can't be sure of the actual mileage . The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the restoration , except for a new carb and a few hoses . He plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine . The body and undercarriage have no visible rust , the interior is new , as are tires , front brakes ( not sure about the back ) , battery , bumpers and other misc parts . The paint is checked in a few places , and scuffed here and there , allegedly by a wind-blown car cover . It seemed to handle OK , except for soft front shocks . Questions : Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out ? The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective ; what should we expect in the way of braking action ? It seemed to be " doggy " when accelerating from a stop . What should we expect it to do , given the 4 - cylinder engine ? The top is in place , but will not reach a number of the snaps . The weather was cold . Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up , or is it forever shrunk ? Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted , or are they usually chromed ?

Shaz ... Shaz , Hmm .. but the service indicators that I have works this way : There are 5 green , 1 yellow , 1 red indicators . initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car . The computer will actually " sense " how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on . And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off . After service the mechanic ( or you ) will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting again . So I expect to have a tool ( or a procedure ) to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off . I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator . It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a surprise to me . and it's a big plus :-) . But I wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time , I thought it's the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil .

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning . You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road . ( 2 ) Tires age .

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN $ 14000 right now . The car has 96000 km ( or about 60000 miles ) on it . A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km ( or about 43K mi ) . The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards . ( He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me . ) Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars , I don't know what this could mean ... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items ? Or is this an indication that the car was abused ? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon ? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot , but , I don't know how to verify this ... I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood , though . Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept , it's currently out of warranty ( a similarly priced ' 90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left ) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills ... But , I also need a car for 5 people ... When will the new Maxima come out , by the way ? I would very much appreciate your input in this .

( i . e . if you lift off briefly , it will remain in the low gear . this is handy if you are charging through corners and would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's another curve approaching ) 3 ) part throttle downshifts , based on the * speed * at which the pedal is depressed , rather than the * position * of the pedal . modern electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode . this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about to turn red . my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough . also , i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick , all else being equal .. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation .. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear ( of a 5 speed ) ? how many % of people who drive manuals * really * know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation ? i'm sure there will be some who know , but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario / ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better . i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout ... high gear , low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear , high revs and small throttle opening . the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it , but not that obvious at first sight . eliotFrom : mliggett@silver.ucs.indiana.edu ( matthew liggett ) Subject : Re : Opel owners ?

Indeed . ) the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4 , so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length .. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain . i think that subaru's ads hold water . in practice , their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free , though some may not like its peculiar note . but as alfa has shown , a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach . eliotFrom : erini@enterprise.ifp.uiuc.edu ( Erini Doss ) Subject : TRUCKING INDUSTRY which are them main trucking companeies and their locations ? do you have the name of ac a contact person ? thanks .. email at erini@enterprise.ifp.uiuc.eduFrom : tut@cairo.Eng.Sun.COM ( Bill " Bill " Tuthill ) Subject : Re : comparing saabs & bmw's edwards@world.std.com ( Jonathan Edwards ) writes : > > BMW's * * SUCK * * in the snow .

Any comments > will be appreciated . Thanks . This is a tricky situation ; if the previous owner didn't inform the dealer of the odometer change , then the previous owner committed fraud , and he may be liable . The dealer may also be liable ; If the previous owner notified the dealer , or if the previous owner had the dash replaced at a dealer , or if the previous owner had the dash changed legally , any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered . If a dealer changes the speedometer , he has to report it ( it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer , and on the title , if I remember correctly ; the dealer told me that the old mileage , etc . were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo was replaced ) . If the odometer can be set to the old mileage , it must be ; if it can't ( eg , electrically-driven odometers ) then the mileage of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is affixed to the door frame of the vehicle . Either way , if the change had been done legally , then a records search ( which the dealer almost certainly did ) should have turned it up .

Ok , here's what I understand : The SL / SL1 / SL2 / SW1 / SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars : Honda Civic Toyota Tercel ( SL , SL1 ) Toyota Corolla ( SL1 , SL2 ) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323 / Protoge ' Subaru Loyale / Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth / Dodge Colt Their core competition is the Civic , Corolla , and Sentra . Most of the other models are in the same class , but aren't the first cars you would think of . I threw in the Escort / Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats . I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier , Sunbird , Shadow , Sundance , Tempo , and Topaz , since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots . The SC1 / SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars : Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si / Civic Coupes / del Sol Si Nissan NX1600 / NX2000 Mazda MX - 3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT If you look at the prices of these cars , they're more expensive than they're 4 - door counterparts . The is good reason for this . It is a more upscale and trend-driven market . Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms , their interior , etc . is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices . Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of : Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600 / NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX - 3 ( not sure on this one ) Stylus -> Impulse / Storm To illustrate , a Tercel starts at around $ 8000 , while the Paseo starts at around $ 11,000 . Even a 4 - door Tercel will cost less than a 2 - door Paseo . Now , you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4 - doors offer . What I mean is that there is no 4 - dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative . Let's take another example : the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS / Storm GSi . Both have the same powerplants ( a 1.6 L 140hp engine ) , but the smaller 2 - dr coupes are generally more expensive . Again , this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment . People are willing to pay more money for this type of car . In short , even though the SC1 / SC2 may be smaller , hence " less " car , it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan ( SL1 / SL2 ) version .

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is " a characteristic of the transmission . " Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to only 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8 600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for " engine longevity " reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a bad individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.comFrom : callison@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu ( James P .

Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater feels better in this aspect . Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and 140,000 kms respectively . My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every respect except smooth clutch engagement . Of course the Kawasaki is the best of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time . The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1 , and after three years and 67,000 kms is no better . Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection .

Here in the states , people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50 + mph .

If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death > due to less that wise driving practices , then TOUGH ! ! ! Well , I never wrote that I would act as you described . I stated that I would not block a would-be passer . I would not block a would-be passer " for their own good " or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance . I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident , fatal or otherwise . In fact , I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being " offed " or involved in an accident , especially if this " passer " is riding your bumper . Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a " wise driving practice " , it only causes the jam to become more congested . I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the road behind ! If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a " pack " of vehicles , I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe . Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life , or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear . If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper , I signal my intention to move to the right , and do so at the first opportunity ( & hope they will open the jam ) . I feel this is not only courteous driving , but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate ! ! ! There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others . If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights , or , if all else fails , will briefly speed up / slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass . I feel it is never safe to ride anyone's bumper . IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic , because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason , I feel they deserve , at the very least , derision .

If you don't already know it , you should call the bank / credit union / finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost . If you are trading in your current car on the new car , subtract the payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you . ( If this turns out to be a negative number , you need to reconsider the deal . ) Subtract this difference from the price of the new car . This is the size of the loan you will need for the new car .

S . Department of Energy . Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles To : National Desk , Environment and Energy Reporters Contact : Larry Hart of the U . S . Department of Energy , 202-586-5806 WASHINGTON , April 21 - - Secretary of Energy Hazel R . O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a " driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies . " President Clinton signed the order today , which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 . President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order . " I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen , " O'Leary said . " As Land Commissioner , Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels , and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country . " The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation . " The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical , affordable choice for fleet owners across the country , " O'Leary said . " Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs . We believe that energy efficiency , protecting the environment , and a healthy economy are complimentary goals . " O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies ' five-year purchase plans , help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs , and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical . Under the order , the Department of Energy will also be working with states , local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available . - 30 - - - Canada Remote Systems - Toronto , Ontario 416-629-7000 / 629-7044From : pamuelle@ingr.com ( Phil Mueller ) Subject : Re : Used BMW Question ... ? ? ?

Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12 . You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society ( MACS ) , that is , the people who stand to rake in that $ 300 to $ 1000 per retrofit per automobile , have mounted an organized campaign to squash those R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether ( on very shaky technical grounds , at best , on outright lies at worst ) .

They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60 ' s racial struggles . I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong , but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth . They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans , and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection . In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection , the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from .

Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system . I knew I would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem . I should add that the clutch is original , and that I've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch . My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal , the angle of the piston rod ( attached to the pedal ) is off the axix of the cylinder , thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it . What do you think of that as an explanation ? Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in ? Now the ' 86 : same problem , except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out ( by way of the master cylinder , into the passenger compartment ) while I was on vacation for 10 days , during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort . What can you suggest here ? Many thanks . Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this ...

I knew about this previously , but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss ( their resident tech type ) discussed these products , and recommends not using them ( i . e , the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners ) . Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors . And although the others ( ethyl based ) do clean injectors they also cause rubber components in the fuel system to deteriorate , and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system . I use a product recommended by VW called 44K ( by BG Products , Inc . ) . It cost more about $ 14.00 , but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects , and its results are supposed to last from 2k to 4k miles .

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission . Since the car was bought new , while shifting from 2nd to 3rd , unless I do it SLOWLY and carefully , it makes a " popping " or " hitting " sound . The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service ( reached by an 800 # ) say this is NORMAL for the car . IS IT ? And about a year ago , at 35Kmiles , the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse : 1 - The shifter would not budge . The clutch had no effect . 2 - The front tires would not budge , even when the clutch is fully depressed . 3 - If the clutch is released the engine would die . 4 - Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck , I could not make the car move . It acted as if it were in Neutral ( except for dying when clutch is released . ) 5 - I finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth ( less than an inch ) , while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter . 6 - The shifter acted normally after that . When this happened , I took it to the dealer , they checked the clutch , it was o . k . They checked the transmission , it was o . k . I had the exact problem a couple of months ago , and again last week . The dealer says there is nothing they can do because Mitsubishi ( the 800 # ) says they have never heard of the problem , and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car . In all three occurances , the car was parked head first in a garage , and since the front wheels were stuck , the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter ( hence temporarily solving the problem ) . And the dealer , and Mitsubishi , refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck . I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission ( shifting from 2nd to 3rd ) , and getting stuck at random , but I can't get the dealer to fix it . I need your help with the mechanical problems , and with how to handle Mitsubishi . All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated , and sorry to bore you with the long post .

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most , when they do , are too shallow to use ! I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car . It is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty ( ie a locked car ! ) . Puting keys and walet looks ugly ! It breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows ! Also , to have the habits that work for any clothing situation , the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing ! ( even nude or a bikni ) A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets ( 2 on the outside , none on the inside ) . I have men's coats that have as much as 6 pockets ! This is definitally not fair ! ! ! As one that wears both men's and women's clothes , I can tell you , women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets ! When dressed as a man , I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket . It is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better . Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman's safty . Men don't see this as a problem . A woman is aware of this every time she goes out ! ( i . e .

One more way , which works in manual trans cars I've driven , and it is my personal favorite ( the other suggestions above are great , but try this one , too ) . While pushing the shifter * gently * towards reverse , let the clutch out slowly ( right to the friction point ) and the shifter will be pulled into position .

I found my Shelby-American guide . There were a grand total 126 GT - 40s built : GT - 40 Coupes 55 GT - 40 Road Cars 31 GT - 40 Mk II 13 GT - 40 Mk IIIs 7 GT - 40 Roadsters 5 Mirages 3 GT - 40 Mk IVs 12 TOTAL : 126 Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs 6-12 Twelve of these cars were prototypes ; 48 racing coupes ; 31 road coupes ; eight Mk II coupes ; 4 LHD Mk IIIs ; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs . The other breakdowns follow the above list ( eg , 12 were Mk IVs ) . The LHD / RHD breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs . The prices ( for those which can be bought ) are around the $ 1 Million mark , last I heard , with a projection of some $ 3.5 Million ( or thereabouts ) in 2000 . It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-) . Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in ' 65 ; that was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing team ( in favor of the Ford GT program the next year ) . That victory broke a 13 ( ? ) year Ferarri winning streak . Well , there's lotsa info I could spout , but I'll refrain . Much of this information comes from " Hot Rod " magazine's " Shelby American Cobra / Mustang Guide , " which has more info on the Shelby-American Fords than you could _ever_ want to know .

Pronto . Until as such time as Korea decides > that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade > with the USA and Japan . Now , now , before we get too carried away here ... Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford . Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership ; last I heard , there were seven different fees to pay to own a car . I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate . Basically , I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class . In exchange , zaibatsu's like Hyundai screwed over smaller companies , perpetuating a vicious cycle . I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else , but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society , of screwy components that won't work together .

S > DON'T BUY IT ! All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on . ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know BMW's are not cheap to fix either . The owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone . Sure $ 3000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be . It sounds like you would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more . Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned . Who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven . Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear . For all you know it could have 200,000 miles on it . The thing you have to remember is that this isn't the last 528i around either . Just wait and keep shopping . For around $ 5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better , needs less repair , and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering . Take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times . Good luck .

I recently bought a 2 band detector . You guys must all think I'm nuts , right ? Well , I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states . Here's how I found out : - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know what Ka is . He's heard of K , which is what they use here and I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc .. He then said , yeah , " Ka stands for K automatic " ... duuhh . He then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned , but he didn't know too much . - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps , even the real sneaky ones . - When I called the Escort Shop , they confirmed that Ka is not used here or in surrounding states . They did claim that Laser was being used a lot here , which I was quite skeptical of . So in the end , instead of spending a lot of money and / or waiting months for a state of the art detector , I got a low priced , high performance 2 band Escort 2200 . Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection . I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately , but I've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good , which was good enough for me and my wallet . eliotFrom : nuet_ke@pts.mot.com ( KEITH NUETZMAN X3153 P7625 ) Subject : Re : Lois Chevrolet ?

All opinions , benchmarks , > > > recommendations , etc . are welcome . The Civic does still come in a 4 door model . My wife and I looked quite seriously at the 626 , Prizm ( Corolla ) , and Civic , as well as some other cars . Our impressions : all three seemed well built and had the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want except for cruise control , and we want a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes . I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus . In general , comfort and performance were both significant . Some specific + ' s and - ' s are listed below . Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model , though in practice this is hard to find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like : tach , variable speed wipers , rear defroster , 60/40 split folding rear seat - more expensive than many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here + comfortable front seat + adjustable seat belt mounting - no ABS without EX model ( includes $ 1000 ' s of other things like a sunroof ) Geo Prizm / Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us ( your mileage may vary ) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quite comfortable , though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding + ' s , but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower " would you buy that car again " and safety ratings in Consumer Reports ( than first 3 cars above ) - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others ( this would be a + for some ) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626 , and in our minds , not significantly better . We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the " big 3 " , due ( a ) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products , ( b ) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine ( c ) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission , I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable , and the escort has attack belts and no air bag . We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A / C and cassette advertised for just under $ 12800 ( Washington Post , April 14 , I think ) , and my local dealer says they can match that price . I will probably get the 626 ( maybe tomorrow ) . The main question in my mind is whether or not I will have to do a " factory order " or " preference order " to get one with ABS , and whether or not the dealership will run the price up a lot if I do so .From : jchen@wind.bellcore.com ( Jason Chen ) Subject : MILITECH I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show , and would like to hear your comments . MILITECH ( tm ) is yet another oil additive . But the demonstration of this product really impressive , if it didn't cheat . The setup of the demo is fairly simple . A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink , filled with motor oil . The rotor is powered by an electronic motor . A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction . The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench . Before MILITECH was added , the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque ( You pick the brand of oil , no difference ) . Once MILITECH was added to the oil , the rotor could not be stopped even with 120 + lb-ft of torque . Here is the good part : even after the salesman emptied the oil sink , you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it . They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles . A 16 oz bottle is $ 25 . I still have my doubts . If this product is really so great , why it was so little known ? The salesman said it is widely used in military . I didn't believe it . The demo was so impressive , that I bought a bottle against my common sense . Has anyone heard of or actually used this product ? Is it real ? If you are going to the auto show , please visit this stand on the second floor . See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not .

Now i'm looking at a Datsun 240Z for sale in our local buy & sell . Any previous owners have any experience with these cars ? Besides looking for rust , good compression , low miles , and all the other usual car things one looks for , is there anything special about these cars that I should watch out for ? How about things like handling , performance , mileage , etc . These cars look hot , to my eyes at least , and bear more than a passing resemblance to the Aston Martin DB4 Zagato ( sp ? ) , which has to be one of the most beatiful cars ever made .

If a manual transmission is a " must have " , then the M-B 300TE is not in the running . You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North America . It seems that buyers here ( or , maybe more accurately , the distributors ) are not interested in manual trannies . The ' 93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine . All earlier years are 177 hp . I have an ' 87 300E , with a " mere " 177 hp and auto tranny , and I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation . More is always nice , but I can't complain . I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall . Here are my impressions : 1 ) Awesome power , especially over 3500rpm , when the turbo really comes on . 2 ) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner , the front-wheel drive causes it to understeer heavily , and then viciously " hook " into the corner . Not a desirable handling trait , but common in powerful front drive cars . ( The CSE is 200hp . Mercedes is rear-drive , so it does not have this problem . ) 3 ) Huge interior and cargo space . 4 ) The most " rubbery " shifter I have ever encountered . I drove a 5spd . It was absolutely numb . You might be able to get used to it - I don't know . I also didn't like its location , which was too far down , and too far right . From the shifter's position , I got the impression that Saab really designed the car for an automatic . 5 ) It was rather noisy : Engine buzz , rattles , and creaks . ( Mercedes does not exhibit these characteristics . ) You should also check out the new BMW 525 " touring " . This is a wagon version of the 525i . It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs . - - Michael Chmilar chmilar@apple.comFrom : jgoss@gaia.torolab.ibm.com ( Jeff Goss ) Subject : Re : Honda clutch chatter In article <185900001@hpindda.cup.hp.com> jimb@hpindda.cup.hp.com ( James Bruder ) writes : > From : jimb@hpindda.cup.hp.com ( James Bruder ) > Date : Wed , 21 Apr 1993 22:01 : 32 GMT > Organization : HP Information Networks , Cupertino , CA > Path : eclipse ! yktnews.watson.ibm.com ! hawnews.watson.ibm.com ! newsgate.watson.ibm.com ! news.ans.net ! howland.reston.ans.net ! usc ! sdd.hp.com ! hpscit.sc.hp.com ! hplextra ! hpcss 01 ! hpindda ! jimb > Newsgroups : rec.autos > Lines : 12 > > anyone else experiencing a similar problem ? > > This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed .

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room . Fully stocked , it cost ~ $ 40,000 . I think it is worth the money . Only problem is when you get into accident ( it doesn't usually break down unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something stupid like this ) , body parts and other parts are very hard to locate . Parts are over priced also . One of my friend had accident in past snow storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender . Well , if you test drive Land Cruiser , all other SUV look like toys . One of magazine writer called it " Land Bruiser " .

It was based on the old Kadett drive train and suspension , with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front . It looked good , but was limited as a performer . There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other models . In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models , the 1900 series , that were also known as model numbers 51 , 57 , etc . These cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes , a station wagon , and a " sport coupe " , known in Europe as the Manta . At the same time , there were two 30 - series cars , which sold very few numbers , that also had the 1900 engine but the Kadett suspension . The sport coupe , ( model 57 ) was also available as the Rallye , ( 57R ) , with a blacked out hood , tach , and fog lights , but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio . In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US . 1973 was the last year for the GT in any country , both because of the US bumper height regulations and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing to build the GTs . The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences . In 1975 , the Manta , 1900 sedan ( also called the Ascona ) and the wagon were available with Bosch electronic fuel injection . These cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels . These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century low price leader of the time , and were the last Opels imported into the US . From 1976 to 1979 , cars that sported Buick / Opel badges were still sold by the Buick dealers , but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks . The idea was to call them Opels instead of changing the dealers ' neon signs . Various models of the 50 - series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the 70 ' s in their class , and were known as serious 2002 - competition . Parts are still available from a number of sources . ( I still have a ' 73 manta and two ' 75 sedans and all the trick parts I could collect in 20 years ) . - - John Kennedy uunet ! opel ! johnk Second Source , Inc . johnk@secondsource.COM Annapolis , MDFrom : bowmanj@csn.org ( Jerry Bowman ) Subject : Re : V4 V6 V8 V12 Vx ?

As far as collectivity / speculation is concerned they think it is a waste of time , especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least desirable , a 1962 original model the most .

Oh , that's not so bad . Every time I try to change the oil , I forget to shut off the engine first . The hot oil comes out and scalds me , blinds me , then the engine starts to overheat , and while I'm screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car , I grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands . My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car , and I struggle to my feet in front of the car , whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant . Then the engine seizes , but not before the cylinder head explodes , piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron . This happens every time . I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic $ 25 instead paying the hospital $ 250,000 and the dealer $ 25,000 for a new car . This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles . - ToadfaceSubject : Convertibles From : bouton@gertrude.cms.udel.edu ( Katherine Bouton ) I was wondering if someone could point me to somewhere I could find a list ( and hopefully comparison ) of all the convertibles that are out these days .

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles , on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k . I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission . My experiences suggest otherwise . What techniques do you use ? On some old pieces of junk I drove , the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift , except clutchless . To date I've driven rabbits , datsuns , comets , fords & a chevy . Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift . My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever . If for some reason I miss the shift window , I lightly press the accelerator & try agian . I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser / quicker at high rpms ( 4000-7000 ) .

Here in the states , people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50 + mph . I don't think this is because they are stupid ( of course , there are exceptions ) , they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit . Do you ( in the states ) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future positions of cars based on a 50 + speed differential . > Dont get me wrong , I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake > cars who are on the right , I slow down a tad bit . If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car , to recognize the speed differential , I would be the stupid one . just to satiate my curiosity , why would this make you the stupid one ? It seems to me , everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on . You do not need to calculate the future position . You need to look at your mirrors a little more . If you glance around , you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is going . Maybe not precisely , but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass . I know what you are talking about , about the other driver being startled , because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around 90-100 mph when i'm doin 55-65 .

More than that . GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR . When locals showed a reluctance to BUY the units , GEICO started giving them away . I know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol , County Sheriff's a and some local governments . The real question is why ? This is the hook . GEICO , and other Ins . Co . s can tell which drivers represent risk . This is a determination they can make AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units . Most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two , but this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK . It's called extra profits . They also know how silly the NSL is , and how it is almost universally ignored . Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket , an increase in your rates , points on your license - - - but it doesn't make you a riskier driver to insure . Like the sound of this ? Like the people who thought up the scheme ? Go GEICO ! Unless you have some driving history problems , you're usually better to go with one of the major companies and stay there . You'll get long term customer discounts on your premiums . Now , about the % of your premium that is paid as commission .

The earlier cars ( pre 74-1 / 2 ) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers ( ride height , generally more power ) . The older cars are appreciating ... slowly . The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment . $ 6 to $ 8k would require extremely good condition and low miles . If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it , the car should last for a long time . There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere . The MGB is a great , fun little car .

You raise a valid point , but again it's a tradeoff - - how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection ? You could buy a Volvo , Saab , or ' Benz and get really good crash protection ( and other luxuries ) but you'll pay significantly more for it . In my case it's out of the question because * all * of those cars are beyond my budget . Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3 - point seatbelt .

I have recently purchased ( within the last 8 months ) the BEL 966STW . While it is not a perfect detector by any means , it does do the job fairly well . Now , however , I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering . So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands ( X , K , Ka photo , Ka wideband ) as well as the new Super Ka wideband . Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs ( for the average home consumer , at least ) , it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors . Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my " new " detector ? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment ? If so , it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine . I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport . Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector .

It depends on your priorities . A lot of people put higher priorities on gas mileage and cost than on safety , buying " unsafe " econoboxes instead of Volvos . I personally take a middle ground - - the only thing I really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5 + mph bumpers .

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live . If you live in a place where crime is apparent , then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent . However , if a professional thief wants your vehicle , its as good as gone no matter what you do . But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options . That would be : 1 ) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2 ) a flashing red LED These two are basic to a decent alarm system . To slow down the criminal some more , get a steering wheel lock . That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target . But , then there's always car-jacking . Why is life so confusing ?

My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5 oz . more than the others . The locking lugnuts were factory equipment , and according to the factory service manual , after tire balancing the technician / mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz . counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut . I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly . I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts . Unfortunately , I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts . :-( My present car , a Saturn SC , has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn . They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts ( said so on the package and I verified it myself ) . I haven't had any vibration problems with the tires at all ( due to the nuts ) in 12,000 of ownership . I did have some other vibration problems , but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing .

Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack , that do the job as competently ( albeit , not as swiftly ) , if not more accurate , due to the natural pride an owner / mechanic places on his work .

Of course it releases radiation ! Thats why your car goes faster when you punch the holes in it . All that radiation gets on your engine and gives it " pep " ( scientific term ) .

On the other hand , it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on the road ( in a parking lot , etc . ) has fine scratches throughout the paint job . As does , alas , my 1992 Laser . Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed . When I picked it up , it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it . Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work . As an added bonus , they washed my car . Unfortunately , whoever washed it either didn't get the roof ( which is black , the rest of the car is red ) completely clean before he dried it , or he used a dirty towel . Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle . I am , to put it mildy , somewhat peeved about this . Do I have any chance of getting the dealership to do something about this ? My guess is ' no ' . Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem ?

" - Firesign TheatreFrom : jackw@boi.hp.com ( jack wood ) Subject : BBB Autoline Arbitration My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over . The outcome was decidedly mixed . I won the battle but lost the war . The arbitrator found that the car was defective , but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :( . At the time of the hearing , average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $ 21,025 , but the decision was for $ 17,665 . I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly , the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you . There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase . The attitude of Chevrolet's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view ; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously . I decided to take the repurchase , even though I am getting totally screwed on the price . I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself , and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law . I am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is . The law allows for a " use deduction " equal to the IRS mileage allowance . As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance . Summary of the case : In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup . Between May 1992 and December 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair . Systems that required attention included the transmission , heater fan , paint , suspension , and motor . The main problem was the five speed manual transmission . They could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts . So , in summary , it is possible to get a repurchase , but you are going to get screwed on the price , unless you paid too much in the first place , or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly . jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.comSubject : Re : Ford SHO engine parts !

You know , I'm a Ford fan , I must say , so I'm looking forward to the next Mustang . I have faith that it will be a fine product , more desireable than the Camaro is now . You know , that's MHO . The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality , just the philosophy . It used to be quality _and_ philosophy . GM is barely catching up , but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time . STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk / door / hood / panel alignments ; it's those 75 year old plants . And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash ( tm ) . But like I said , they're getting better and making the move in the right direction . They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro / Firebird , but really only in words . Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year , keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there . I wouldn't press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it . Besides , no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway . I do not put much stock in the mag rags ' " inside " information , or even Ford rep quotes . The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's entirety . " Inside " information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point . I wouldn't look for a simple re-paneled Mustang , folks ; you may be cheating yourself if you do . There's a lot of potential . Ford hasn't released a new car without a 4 - wheel IS in 7 years . The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4 , right ? A 4 - wheel IS could happen . Those modular V8 ' s are out there , too . In the interest of CAFE and competition , don't rule those out , either . Your ignorant if you do . And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there , who really knows what it'll look like ? The Mach III ? Doubt it . Highly . The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car . It attracts way more attention than the Camaro / Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general public . Don't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that . I submit that the Mustang will be a success . Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here . You know , intelligent , critical spews like , " The Mustang bites , man ! " Some of you are already beginning . I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers , as usual . I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel , as usual . The Camaro is still a huge automobile ; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short , pony-car wheelbase . The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot , while the Mustang will appeal to the driver . The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set , while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set . Both will be more refined ( I do think the Camaro is ) . There will be no clear winner . Unless the Ford gets the 32v , 300hp Romeo .

I'll pick up that PM and have a look - - maybe the picture in there is not the actual car , but a prototype ?

At the same It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers ... For a little perspective : How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies to help children , seniors , the homeless ? Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas ? What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others ) who worked to clean up the mess after the Rodney King riots in LA ? Have you gone to your local high school play recently ? Attended the school orchestra performances ? Have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash , plant trees , do walk-a-thons ? How many kids have tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to ? How many girl scout cookies have you bought ? How many chocolate bars for good causes ?

What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at school , get good grades , go to college ( or to work ) and make a real contribution to our society ?

I'd assume easier , > since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting > gasses . Let's hear people's opinions ... The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca . emissions laws involves three things I know of : 1 . All compliant diesels are turbocharged . 2 . All use an " aftercooler " , which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger ( up to about 25 PSI ) . 3 . A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake , and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is low . No scrubbers , catalytic converters , etc , are used . The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free . Interestingly , except for the low-pressure fuel limitation , power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures . One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power , lots more power , and these are approved by the CARB .

For the information of those not " lucky " enough to live in the city of Austin , TX , if an auto a / c system is checked and found to have leaks , it must be repaired at that time , or evacuated .

I bought it in California , and if it'll let me , I'd like to keep it for another year . The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work . The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents . Right now it is stuck in the " vent " mode . It will blow warm air , but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor ( I can live without this ) or the defrost ( I can't live without this ) . I probably could just jam the air deflector to the defrost position , but this blows a lot of air in my face and is , well , kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse .

THe diaphragm which controls outside ( vent ) / in - side ( no vent ) air is cracked most of the way around , and the other one is probably damaged too , considering the advanced age of the car .

He plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine . The body and undercarriage have no visible rust , the interior is new , as are tires , front brakes ( not sure about the back ) , battery , bumpers and other misc parts . The paint is checked in a few places , and scuffed here and there , allegedly by a wind-blown car cover . It seemed to handle OK , except for soft front shocks . Questions : Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out ? The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective ; what should we expect in the way of braking action ? It seemed to be " doggy " when accelerating from a stop . What should we expect it to do , given the 4 - cylinder engine ? The top is in place , but will not reach a number of the snaps .

No minor modification ( wheel well treatments , tail amp modification , or nose re-design or even the LT1 engine ) will help the existing Caprice .

Shaz ... Shaz , Hmm .. but the service indicators that I have works this way : There are 5 green , 1 yellow , 1 red indicators . initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start your car . The computer will actually " sense " how you drive your car and as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go on . And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off . After service the mechanic ( or you ) will reset the service indicators and the computer starts counting again . So I expect to have a tool ( or a procedure ) to reset it so the green lights will come on and the yellow and red lights will go off . I wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the indicator . It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a surprise to me . and it's a big plus :-) . But I wonder how that could happen since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time , I thought it's the oil and not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil .

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN $ 14000 right now . The car has 96000 km ( or about 60000 miles ) on it . A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km ( or about 43K mi ) . The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards . ( He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me . ) Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars , I don't know what this could mean ... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items ? Or is this an indication that the car was abused ? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon ? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot , but , I don't know how to verify this ... I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood , though . Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept , it's currently out of warranty ( a similarly priced ' 90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left ) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills ... But , I also need a car for 5 people ... When will the new Maxima come out , by the way ? I would very much appreciate your input in this .

( Technology shared with > Porsche . Indeed . ) the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4 , so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length .. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain . i think that subaru's ads hold water . in practice , their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free , though some may not like its peculiar note . but as alfa has shown , a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach . eliotFrom : erini@enterprise.ifp.uiuc.edu ( Erini Doss ) Subject : TRUCKING INDUSTRY which are them main trucking companeies and their locations ? do you have the name of ac a contact person ? thanks .. email at erini@enterprise.ifp.uiuc.eduFrom : tut@cairo.Eng.Sun.COM ( Bill " Bill " Tuthill ) Subject : Re : comparing saabs & bmw's edwards@world.std.com ( Jonathan Edwards ) writes : > > BMW's * * SUCK * * in the snow .

For a reasonable sum , you can get a BMW with traction control : a torque-sensing ( limited slip ) rear differential .

Any comments > will be appreciated . Thanks . This is a tricky situation ; if the previous owner didn't inform the dealer of the odometer change , then the previous owner committed fraud , and he may be liable . The dealer may also be liable ; If the previous owner notified the dealer , or if the previous owner had the dash replaced at a dealer , or if the previous owner had the dash changed legally , any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered . If a dealer changes the speedometer , he has to report it ( it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer , and on the title , if I remember correctly ; the dealer told me that the old mileage , etc . were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo was replaced ) . If the odometer can be set to the old mileage , it must be ; if it can't ( eg , electrically-driven odometers ) then the mileage of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is affixed to the door frame of the vehicle . Either way , if the change had been done legally , then a records search ( which the dealer almost certainly did ) should have turned it up .

Ok , here's what I understand : The SL / SL1 / SL2 / SW1 / SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars : Honda Civic Toyota Tercel ( SL , SL1 ) Toyota Corolla ( SL1 , SL2 ) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323 / Protoge ' Subaru Loyale / Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth / Dodge Colt Their core competition is the Civic , Corolla , and Sentra . Most of the other models are in the same class , but aren't the first cars you would think of . I threw in the Escort / Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats . I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier , Sunbird , Shadow , Sundance , Tempo , and Topaz , since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots . The SC1 / SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars : Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si / Civic Coupes / del Sol Si Nissan NX1600 / NX2000 Mazda MX - 3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT If you look at the prices of these cars , they're more expensive than they're 4 - door counterparts . The is good reason for this . It is a more upscale and trend-driven market . Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms , their interior , etc . is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices . Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of : Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600 / NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX - 3 ( not sure on this one ) Stylus -> Impulse / Storm To illustrate , a Tercel starts at around $ 8000 , while the Paseo starts at around $ 11,000 . Even a 4 - door Tercel will cost less than a 2 - door Paseo . Now , you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4 - doors offer . What I mean is that there is no 4 - dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative . Let's take another example : the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS / Storm GSi . Both have the same powerplants ( a 1.6 L 140hp engine ) , but the smaller 2 - dr coupes are generally more expensive . Again , this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment . People are willing to pay more money for this type of car . In short , even though the SC1 / SC2 may be smaller , hence " less " car , it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan ( SL1 / SL2 ) version .

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators , and I've never seen nor heard of a vandal opening one . I imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have to crawl furthur under the car to open it .

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May . It has had many , many problems . See my earler post that describes the situation . I went to BBB arbitration , and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me . If you do get one , stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear . They have put three of them in my truck so far . After about 1,500 miles , overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly . There is no way to fix them . Chevrolet says that the noise is " a characteristic of the transmission . " Also , if you are planning to use your truck to tow , the gear ratios in that tranny suck . On a steep hill , you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM ( yellow line ) . If you shift to third , the RPM drop to only 2,500 , and you begin to loose speed . I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8 600 GVW ) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones . They dropped the compression ratio , supposedly for " engine longevity " reasons . So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does . Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan ( 3 times so far ) , paint ( had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering ) , and suspension parts ( link between stabilizer and control arm fell off ) . Any company can make a bad individual car , Chevrolet included . What really bothered me was the way they reacted . They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for them to attempt to fix it one more time . So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic . I will never buy another Chevrolet . jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.comFrom : callison@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu ( James P .

Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater feels better in this aspect . Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and 140,000 kms respectively . My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every respect except smooth clutch engagement . Of course the Kawasaki is the best of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time . The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1 , and after three years and 67,000 kms is no better . Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection .

If you get frustrated by somebody delaying your inevitable death > due to less that wise driving practices , then TOUGH ! ! ! Well , I never wrote that I would act as you described . I stated that I would not block a would-be passer . I would not block a would-be passer " for their own good " or for any reason other than I was prevented from doing so due to the traffic circumstance . I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident , fatal or otherwise . In fact , I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your chances of being " offed " or involved in an accident , especially if this " passer " is riding your bumper . Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a " wise driving practice " , it only causes the jam to become more congested . I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the road behind ! If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a " pack " of vehicles , I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you decribe . Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal with this fact of life , or I wait to a slow passer to complete their pass and make way for the pack to clear . If someone decides then to pull up on my bumper , I signal my intention to move to the right , and do so at the first opportunity ( & hope they will open the jam ) . I feel this is not only courteous driving , but ALOT safer than the actions you advocate ! ! ! There are actually many courteous drivers on the road who do not intentionally impede others . If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights , or , if all else fails , will briefly speed up / slow down so they MIGHT get the message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass . I feel it is never safe to ride anyone's bumper . IF someone is intentionally blocking traffic , because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty or for some unfathomable reason , I feel they deserve , at the very least , derision .

If you don't already know it , you should call the bank / credit union / finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost . If you are trading in your current car on the new car , subtract the payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you . ( If this turns out to be a negative number , you need to reconsider the deal . ) Subtract this difference from the price of the new car . This is the size of the loan you will need for the new car .

Department of Energy , 202-586-5806 WASHINGTON , April 21 - - Secretary of Energy Hazel R . O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a " driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies . " President Clinton signed the order today , which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992 . President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order . " I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen , " O'Leary said . " As Land Commissioner , Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels , and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country . " The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation . " The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical , affordable choice for fleet owners across the country , " O'Leary said . " Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs . We believe that energy efficiency , protecting the environment , and a healthy economy are complimentary goals . " O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies ' five-year purchase plans , help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs , and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical . Under the order , the Department of Energy will also be working with states , local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available . - 30 - - - Canada Remote Systems - Toronto , Ontario 416-629-7000 / 629-7044From : pamuelle@ingr.com ( Phil Mueller ) Subject : Re : Used BMW Question ... ? ? ?

Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for R12 . You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society ( MACS ) , that is , the people who stand to rake in that $ 300 to $ 1000 per retrofit per automobile , have mounted an organized campaign to squash those R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether ( on very shaky technical grounds , at best , on outright lies at worst ) .

I have both an ' 84 and an ' 86 Camry , each with manual 5 - speed transmissions . The ' 84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the ' 86 about 83,000 miles . ABout a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the ' 84 was leaking fluid around the piston seal , leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car . I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit ( new plunger , seal , etc . ) and thought I had the problem licked . Much to my surprise , the same problem developed several months later ! This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches , burrs , or other obvious causes of the problem . I didn't find any . Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system . I knew I would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem . I should add that the clutch is original , and that I've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch . My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal , the angle of the piston rod ( attached to the pedal ) is off the axix of the cylinder , thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it . What do you think of that as an explanation ? Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in ? Now the ' 86 : same problem , except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out ( by way of the master cylinder , into the passenger compartment ) while I was on vacation for 10 days , during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort . What can you suggest here ? Many thanks . Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this ...

Go to KMart and buy the > cleaner yourself for $ 1.29 . Personally , i wouldn't use the $ 1.29 product from KMart . I knew about this previously , but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss ( their resident tech type ) discussed these products , and recommends not using them ( i . e , the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners ) . Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors . And although the others ( ethyl based ) do clean injectors they also cause rubber components in the fuel system to deteriorate , and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system . I use a product recommended by VW called 44K ( by BG Products , Inc . ) . It cost more about $ 14.00 , but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects , and its results are supposed to last from 2k to 4k miles . I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene ( sp ? ) . I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either , since i only use these product as a preventative maintenance item . > > Just because you dealer sez you need it , don't mean it's necessarily so . > Be suspicious . > > jim grey > jwg@acd4.acd.com . / Larry __ / ___ / _ keys@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov / \ ___ __ ___ \ - - - = = = - - - / ___ / / / / __ __ / \ / ___ / / ___ / / / / ___ | | / \ / / __ / | / / __ __ / / __ / \ / / ___ \ ___ / / ___ / / ___ / = = = OO \ / \ / - 1990 2.0 16v - - - - FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER ! - - - The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates that you probably wouldn't understand anyway ! - - -From : swdwan@napier.uwaterloo.ca ( Donald Wan ) Subject : $ 80 SVX OIL CHANGE My friend brought a subaru SVX recently . I had drove it for couples times and I think its a great car , esp on snow . However when she took it to a local Subaru dealer for a oil change , the bill came out to be about 80 dollars . The dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour . At first , we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price . So is there any SVX owner out there that has the same problem ? And if the oil change story is true , then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me . By the way , the car looks great .

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission . Since the car was bought new , while shifting from 2nd to 3rd , unless I do it SLOWLY and carefully , it makes a " popping " or " hitting " sound . The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service ( reached by an 800 # ) say this is NORMAL for the car . IS IT ? And about a year ago , at 35Kmiles , the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse : 1 - The shifter would not budge . The clutch had no effect . 2 - The front tires would not budge , even when the clutch is fully depressed . 3 - If the clutch is released the engine would die . 4 - Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was stuck , I could not make the car move . It acted as if it were in Neutral ( except for dying when clutch is released . ) 5 - I finally was able to release the shifter by having someone rock the car back and forth ( less than an inch ) , while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter . 6 - The shifter acted normally after that . When this happened , I took it to the dealer , they checked the clutch , it was o . k . They checked the transmission , it was o . k . I had the exact problem a couple of months ago , and again last week . The dealer says there is nothing they can do because Mitsubishi ( the 800 # ) says they have never heard of the problem , and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car . In all three occurances , the car was parked head first in a garage , and since the front wheels were stuck , the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter ( hence temporarily solving the problem ) . And the dealer , and Mitsubishi , refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck . I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission ( shifting from 2nd to 3rd ) , and getting stuck at random , but I can't get the dealer to fix it . I need your help with the mechanical problems , and with how to handle Mitsubishi . All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated , and sorry to bore you with the long post . Thanks , Rabih .From : jimb@hpindda.cup.hp.com ( James Bruder ) Subject : Honda clutch chatter anyone else experiencing a similar problem ? This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed . When the clutch is first used in the morning , about the first 4 miles of shifting , there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up . Then the clutch shifts smoothly . This chatter started when I moved to the San Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment . The dealer stated that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to non-asbestos clutch material . No remedy ! ! Seems that moisture on clutch surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates .

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most , when they do , are too shallow to use ! I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car . It is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty ( ie a locked car ! ) . Puting keys and walet looks ugly ! It breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows ! Also , to have the habits that work for any clothing situation , the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing ! ( even nude or a bikni ) A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets ( 2 on the outside , none on the inside ) . I have men's coats that have as much as 6 pockets ! This is definitally not fair ! ! ! As one that wears both men's and women's clothes , I can tell you , women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets ! When dressed as a man , I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket . It is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better . Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman's safty . Men don't see this as a problem . A woman is aware of this every time she goes out ! ( i . e . Image some red necks yelling at you " We are going to FUCK YOU !

One more way , which works in manual trans cars I've driven , and it is my personal favorite ( the other suggestions above are great , but try this one , too ) . While pushing the shifter * gently * towards reverse , let the clutch out slowly ( right to the friction point ) and the shifter will be pulled into position . If you do it right , the car won't jump backward , nor will the gears grind ... You will just glide back . - samFrom : storrs@eos.ncsu.edu ( JERRY STORRS ) Subject : Re : WARNING ...

I found my Shelby-American guide . There were a grand total 126 GT - 40s built : GT - 40 Coupes 55 GT - 40 Road Cars 31 GT - 40 Mk II 13 GT - 40 Mk IIIs 7 GT - 40 Roadsters 5 Mirages 3 GT - 40 Mk IVs 12 TOTAL : 126 Additional uncompleted Mk IIIs 6-12 Twelve of these cars were prototypes ; 48 racing coupes ; 31 road coupes ; eight Mk II coupes ; 4 LHD Mk IIIs ; and 3 RHD Mk IIIs . The other breakdowns follow the above list ( eg , 12 were Mk IVs ) . The LHD / RHD breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs . The prices ( for those which can be bought ) are around the $ 1 Million mark , last I heard , with a projection of some $ 3.5 Million ( or thereabouts ) in 2000 . It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-) . Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in ' 65 ; that was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing team ( in favor of the Ford GT program the next year ) . That victory broke a 13 ( ? ) year Ferarri winning streak . Well , there's lotsa info I could spout , but I'll refrain . Much of this information comes from " Hot Rod " magazine's " Shelby American Cobra / Mustang Guide , " which has more info on the Shelby-American Fords than you could _ever_ want to know .

Pronto . Until as such time as Korea decides > that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade > with the USA and Japan . Now , now , before we get too carried away here ... Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford . Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership ; last I heard , there were seven different fees to pay to own a car . I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate . Basically , I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class . In exchange , zaibatsu's like Hyundai screwed over smaller companies , perpetuating a vicious cycle . I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else , but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society , of screwy components that won't work together .

S > DON'T BUY IT ! All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on . ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know BMW's are not cheap to fix either . The owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone . Sure $ 3000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be . It sounds like you would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more . Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned . Who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven . Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear . For all you know it could have 200,000 miles on it . The thing you have to remember is that this isn't the last 528i around either . Just wait and keep shopping . For around $ 5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better , needs less repair , and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering . Take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times . Good luck .

I recently bought a 2 band detector . You guys must all think I'm nuts , right ? Well , I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states . Here's how I found out : - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know what Ka is . He's heard of K , which is what they use here and I explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc .. He then said , yeah , " Ka stands for K automatic " ... duuhh . He then went on to say that plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high tech were concerned , but he didn't know too much . - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps , even the real sneaky ones . - When I called the Escort Shop , they confirmed that Ka is not used here or in surrounding states . They did claim that Laser was being used a lot here , which I was quite skeptical of . So in the end , instead of spending a lot of money and / or waiting months for a state of the art detector , I got a low priced , high performance 2 band Escort 2200 . Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection . I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately , but I've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good , which was good enough for me and my wallet . eliotFrom : nuet_ke@pts.mot.com ( KEITH NUETZMAN X3153 P7625 ) Subject : Re : Lois Chevrolet ?

All opinions , benchmarks , > > > recommendations , etc . are welcome . The Civic does still come in a 4 door model . My wife and I looked quite seriously at the 626 , Prizm ( Corolla ) , and Civic , as well as some other cars . Our impressions : all three seemed well built and had the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want except for cruise control , and we want a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes . I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus . In general , comfort and performance were both significant . Some specific + ' s and - ' s are listed below . Mazda 626 + very comfortable and roomy + can theoretically get ABS on DX model , though in practice this is hard to find + base price for base model includes numerous little things like : tach , variable speed wipers , rear defroster , 60/40 split folding rear seat - more expensive than many other cars listed below Honda Civic + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here + comfortable front seat + adjustable seat belt mounting - no ABS without EX model ( includes $ 1000 ' s of other things like a sunroof ) Geo Prizm / Toyota Corolla - seats not very comfortable to us ( your mileage may vary ) + adjustable seat belt mounting + can get ABS without lots of other extras Saturn + SL2 was quite comfortable , though SL1 less so - motorized attack belts Dodge Spirit no real outstanding + ' s , but seemed generally ok - rear seat does not fold down Chevy Corsica + comes with ABS standard - lower " would you buy that car again " and safety ratings in Consumer Reports ( than first 3 cars above ) - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others ( this would be a + for some ) The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626 , and in our minds , not significantly better . We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the " big 3 " , due ( a ) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products , ( b ) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine ( c ) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission , I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable , and the escort has attack belts and no air bag . We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A / C and cassette advertised for just under $ 12800 ( Washington Post , April 14 , I think ) , and my local dealer says they can match that price . I will probably get the 626 ( maybe tomorrow ) . The main question in my mind is whether or not I will have to do a " factory order " or " preference order " to get one with ABS , and whether or not the dealership will run the price up a lot if I do so .From : jchen@wind.bellcore.com ( Jason Chen ) Subject : MILITECH I saw an interesting product in NY Auto Show , and would like to hear your comments . MILITECH ( tm ) is yet another oil additive . But the demonstration of this product really impressive , if it didn't cheat . The setup of the demo is fairly simple . A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink , filled with motor oil . The rotor is powered by an electronic motor . A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction . The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench . Before MILITECH was added , the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque ( You pick the brand of oil , no difference ) . Once MILITECH was added to the oil , the rotor could not be stopped even with 120 + lb-ft of torque . Here is the good part : even after the salesman emptied the oil sink , you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained on it . They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles . A 16 oz bottle is $ 25 . I still have my doubts . If this product is really so great , why it was so little known ? The salesman said it is widely used in military . I didn't believe it . The demo was so impressive , that I bought a bottle against my common sense . Has anyone heard of or actually used this product ? Is it real ? If you are going to the auto show , please visit this stand on the second floor . See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not .

If I hear someone screwing with my car ( ie , setting off the alarm ) and taunting me to come out , you can be damn sure that my Colt Delta Elite will also be coming with me . It's not the screwing with the car that'd get them shot , it's the potential physical danger . If they're taunting like that , it's very possible that they also intend to rob me and / or do other physically harmful things . If they're just screwing around , no harm done . If they're bent on mayhem , they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency ; a 180gr . injection @1200 fps ... there's no telling what today's violent criminals will do .

I'm not sure what I was thinking there . It _is_ legal in Oklahoma . On inter-state travel , as long as it is legal for you to own at your point of origination and destination , the gun is carried in a locked compartment / box ( glove box specifically excluded ) separate from the ammo , it is legal under Title 19 , Chapter 44 , Section 94 ( 9 ?

The crusades ? The Salem witch trials ? The religious persecutions of the middle-ages ? What about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over the world ? What about the early Christians put to death by the Romans ? The Jews persecuted by Christians ? There are a lot more humans today than there have ever been . I do not know the stats , but there are far more people on the planet than there were 2 or 3 hundred years ago ! The per capita acts of violence are probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a thousand years ago !

If a manual transmission is a " must have " , then the M-B 300TE is not in the running . You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North America . It seems that buyers here ( or , maybe more accurately , the distributors ) are not interested in manual trannies . The ' 93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine . All earlier years are 177 hp . I have an ' 87 300E , with a " mere " 177 hp and auto tranny , and I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation . More is always nice , but I can't complain . I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall . Here are my impressions : 1 ) Awesome power , especially over 3500rpm , when the turbo really comes on . 2 ) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner , the front-wheel drive causes it to understeer heavily , and then viciously " hook " into the corner . Not a desirable handling trait , but common in powerful front drive cars . ( The CSE is 200hp . Mercedes is rear-drive , so it does not have this problem . ) 3 ) Huge interior and cargo space . 4 ) The most " rubbery " shifter I have ever encountered . I drove a 5spd . It was absolutely numb . You might be able to get used to it - I don't know . I also didn't like its location , which was too far down , and too far right . From the shifter's position , I got the impression that Saab really designed the car for an automatic . 5 ) It was rather noisy : Engine buzz , rattles , and creaks . ( Mercedes does not exhibit these characteristics . ) You should also check out the new BMW 525 " touring " . This is a wagon version of the 525i . It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs . - - Michael Chmilar chmilar@apple.comFrom : jgoss@gaia.torolab.ibm.com ( Jeff Goss ) Subject : Re : Honda clutch chatter In article <185900001@hpindda.cup.hp.com> jimb@hpindda.cup.hp.com ( James Bruder ) writes : > From : jimb@hpindda.cup.hp.com ( James Bruder ) > Date : Wed , 21 Apr 1993 22:01 : 32 GMT > Organization : HP Information Networks , Cupertino , CA > Path : eclipse ! yktnews.watson.ibm.com ! hawnews.watson.ibm.com ! newsgate.watson.ibm.com ! news.ans.net ! howland.reston.ans.net ! usc ! sdd.hp.com ! hpscit.sc.hp.com ! hplextra ! hpcss 01 ! hpindda ! jimb > Newsgroups : rec.autos > Lines : 12 > > anyone else experiencing a similar problem ? > > This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed .

The engine > compartment looks really tight to work on , but it is in fine shape and > I am quite interested in it . That would be the Opel GT , sold in this country from ' 69 to ' 73 . It originally had a 1100 cc engine , which was later replaced by the 1900 cc . It was based on the old Kadett drive train and suspension , with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front . It looked good , but was limited as a performer . There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other models . In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models , the 1900 series , that were also known as model numbers 51 , 57 , etc . These cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes , a station wagon , and a " sport coupe " , known in Europe as the Manta . At the same time , there were two 30 - series cars , which sold very few numbers , that also had the 1900 engine but the Kadett suspension . The sport coupe , ( model 57 ) was also available as the Rallye , ( 57R ) , with a blacked out hood , tach , and fog lights , but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio . In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US . 1973 was the last year for the GT in any country , both because of the US bumper height regulations and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing to build the GTs . The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences . In 1975 , the Manta , 1900 sedan ( also called the Ascona ) and the wagon were available with Bosch electronic fuel injection . These cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels . These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century low price leader of the time , and were the last Opels imported into the US . From 1976 to 1979 , cars that sported Buick / Opel badges were still sold by the Buick dealers , but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks . The idea was to call them Opels instead of changing the dealers ' neon signs . Various models of the 50 - series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the 70 ' s in their class , and were known as serious 2002 - competition . Parts are still available from a number of sources . ( I still have a ' 73 manta and two ' 75 sedans and all the trick parts I could collect in 20 years ) . - - John Kennedy uunet ! opel ! johnk Second Source , Inc . johnk@secondsource.COM Annapolis , MDFrom : bowmanj@csn.org ( Jerry Bowman ) Subject : Re : V4 V6 V8 V12 Vx ?

Oh , that's not so bad . Every time I try to change the oil , I forget to shut off the engine first . The hot oil comes out and scalds me , blinds me , then the engine starts to overheat , and while I'm screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car , I grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands . My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car , and I struggle to my feet in front of the car , whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant . Then the engine seizes , but not before the cylinder head explodes , piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron . This happens every time . I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic $ 25 instead paying the hospital $ 250,000 and the dealer $ 25,000 for a new car .

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles , on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k . I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission . My experiences suggest otherwise . What techniques do you use ? On some old pieces of junk I drove , the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift , except clutchless . To date I've driven rabbits , datsuns , comets , fords & a chevy . Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift . My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever . If for some reason I miss the shift window , I lightly press the accelerator & try agian . I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser / quicker at high rpms ( 4000-7000 ) .

Here in the states , people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50 + mph . I don't think this is because they are stupid ( of course , there are exceptions ) , they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit . Do you ( in the states ) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future positions of cars based on a 50 + speed differential . > Dont get me wrong , I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake > cars who are on the right , I slow down a tad bit . If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car , to recognize the speed differential , I would be the stupid one . just to satiate my curiosity , why would this make you the stupid one ? It seems to me , everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on . You do not need to calculate the future position . You need to look at your mirrors a little more . If you glance around , you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is going . Maybe not precisely , but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass .

More than that . GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR . When locals showed a reluctance to BUY the units , GEICO started giving them away . I know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol , County Sheriff's a and some local governments . The real question is why ? This is the hook . GEICO , and other Ins . Co . s can tell which drivers represent risk . This is a determination they can make AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units . Most drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two , but this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK . It's called extra profits . They also know how silly the NSL is , and how it is almost universally ignored . Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket , an increase in your rates , points on your license - - - but it doesn't make you a riskier driver to insure . Like the sound of this ? Like the people who thought up the scheme ? Go GEICO ! Unless you have some driving history problems , you're usually better to go with one of the major companies and stay there . You'll get long term customer discounts on your premiums . Now , about the % of your premium that is paid as commission .

The earlier cars ( pre 74-1 / 2 ) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having chrome bumpers ( ride height , generally more power ) . The older cars are appreciating ... slowly . The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the moment . $ 6 to $ 8k would require extremely good condition and low miles . If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it , the car should last for a long time . There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere . The MGB is a great , fun little car .

One of the local dealers has a used ( 7k miles ) ' 93 Probe GT on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the window saying the dealership bought the car back from the previous owner because of " Engine noises " , but that the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those noises were " normal " . I thought it was worth looking into ( the car seems otherwise clean ) and mentioned this to a co-worker , who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's ' 93 Probe GT , which had several problems , ending with engine noises which she said " was something with the heads " , that Ford acknowledged the noise , said they were working on it , but didn't have a cure as of yet . Her son traded the car in ( and I checked - - not the same car ) . So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's , and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX - 6 . Anything to this ? I'd love to consider buying the GT ( I'm turning 40 - - time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-) but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner of a Lemon .From : wrat@unisql.UUCP ( wharfie ) Subject : Re : Questions about insurance companies ( esp .

You raise a valid point , but again it's a tradeoff - - how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection ? You could buy a Volvo , Saab , or ' Benz and get really good crash protection ( and other luxuries ) but you'll pay significantly more for it . In my case it's out of the question because * all * of those cars are beyond my budget . Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3 - point seatbelt . Nowadays , at least in the US , you get an airbag if you get a 3 - point belt so ( presumably ) you get an added safety benefit there as well . That's something I certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars . My $ . 02 , of course . jim frost jimf@centerline.comFrom : bowmanj@csn.org ( Jerry Bowman ) Subject : Re : Help ! ! !

I have recently purchased ( within the last 8 months ) the BEL 966STW . While it is not a perfect detector by any means , it does do the job fairly well . Now , however , I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering . So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands ( X , K , Ka photo , Ka wideband ) as well as the new Super Ka wideband . Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs ( for the average home consumer , at least ) , it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors . Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my " new " detector ? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment ? If so , it might be worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine . I was in the market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport . Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector .

Having a lot of experience with a ' 92 Grand Am coupe , I can firmly state that they do have a lot of outstanding qualities . Very reliable throughout . Great layout of controls and components .

It depends on your priorities . A lot of people put higher priorities on gas mileage and cost than on safety , buying " unsafe " econoboxes instead of Volvos .

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live . If you live in a place where crime is apparent , then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent . However , if a professional thief wants your vehicle , its as good as gone no matter what you do . But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options . That would be : 1 ) ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2 ) a flashing red LED These two are basic to a decent alarm system . To slow down the criminal some more , get a steering wheel lock . That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target . But , then there's always car-jacking . Why is life so confusing ?

My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5 oz . more than the others . The locking lugnuts were factory equipment , and according to the factory service manual , after tire balancing the technician / mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz . counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut . I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly . I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts . Unfortunately , I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts . :-( My present car , a Saturn SC , has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn . They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts ( said so on the package and I verified it myself ) . I haven't had any vibration problems with the tires at all ( due to the nuts ) in 12,000 of ownership . I did have some other vibration problems , but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing .

Read the service manual and get your head out of the sand ! Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack , that do the job as competently ( albeit , not as swiftly ) , if not more accurate , due to the natural pride an owner / mechanic places on his work . You can do an ` acceptable ' job of aligning a car using simple tools and some imaginative work that would * never * have the effect of endangering anyones life .

Of course it releases radiation ! Thats why your car goes faster when you punch the holes in it . All that radiation gets on your engine and gives it " pep " ( scientific term ) . You get more horsepower & torque too ! If you don't know what HP & torque are , you can read mile long threads on the subject , but they are all wrong .

Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work . As an added bonus , they washed my car . Unfortunately , whoever washed it either didn't get the roof ( which is black , the rest of the car is red ) completely clean before he dried it , or he used a dirty towel .

" - Firesign TheatreFrom : jackw@boi.hp.com ( jack wood ) Subject : BBB Autoline Arbitration My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over . The outcome was decidedly mixed . I won the battle but lost the war . The arbitrator found that the car was defective , but decided to offer a repurchase well below market value :( . At the time of the hearing , average retail on my truck in the NADA book was $ 21,025 , but the decision was for $ 17,665 . I wrote a letter to the Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the fact that if you have an automobile that does not depreciate rapidly , the manufacturer has no incentive to deal with you . There is no way that the manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded a repurchase . The attitude of Chevrolet's representative at the hearing tends to support this point of view ; he was totally unprepared and did not seem to take the proceeding very seriously . I decided to take the repurchase , even though I am getting totally screwed on the price . I will not have to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon myself , and I have no case for a civil suit based on the Idaho lemon law . I am planning to send a letter to my elected representatives telling them how utterly ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is . The law allows for a " use deduction " equal to the IRS mileage allowance . As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying for my insurance . Summary of the case : In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup . Between May 1992 and December 1992 this vehicle required repair after repair . Systems that required attention included the transmission , heater fan , paint , suspension , and motor . The main problem was the five speed manual transmission . They could not install a non-defective transmission in at least four attempts . So , in summary , it is possible to get a repurchase , but you are going to get screwed on the price , unless you paid too much in the first place , or if your car happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly . jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.comSubject : Re : Ford SHO engine parts !

You know , I'm a Ford fan , I must say , so I'm looking forward to the next Mustang . I have faith that it will be a fine product , more desireable than the Camaro is now . You know , that's MHO . The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality , just the philosophy . It used to be quality _and_ philosophy . GM is barely catching up , but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time . STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk / door / hood / panel alignments ; it's those 75 year old plants . And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash ( tm ) . But like I said , they're getting better and making the move in the right direction . They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro / Firebird , but really only in words . Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year , keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there . I wouldn't press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it . Besides , no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway . I do not put much stock in the mag rags ' " inside " information , or even Ford rep quotes . The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's entirety . " Inside " information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point . I wouldn't look for a simple re-paneled Mustang , folks ; you may be cheating yourself if you do . There's a lot of potential . Ford hasn't released a new car without a 4 - wheel IS in 7 years . The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4 , right ? A 4 - wheel IS could happen . Those modular V8 ' s are out there , too . In the interest of CAFE and competition , don't rule those out , either . Your ignorant if you do . And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there , who really knows what it'll look like ? The Mach III ? Doubt it . Highly . The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car . It attracts way more attention than the Camaro / Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general public . Don't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that . I submit that the Mustang will be a success . Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here . You know , intelligent , critical spews like , " The Mustang bites , man ! " Some of you are already beginning . I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers , as usual . I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel , as usual . The Camaro is still a huge automobile ; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short , pony-car wheelbase . The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot , while the Mustang will appeal to the driver . The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set , while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set . Both will be more refined ( I do think the Camaro is ) . There will be no clear winner . Unless the Ford gets the 32v , 300hp Romeo .

At the same It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers ... For a little perspective : How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies to help children , seniors , the homeless ? Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas ? What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others ) who worked to clean up the mess after the Rodney King riots in LA ? Have you gone to your local high school play recently ? Attended the school orchestra performances ? Have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash , plant trees , do walk-a-thons ?

I'd assume easier , > since we're removing particulate matter instead of converting > gasses . Let's hear people's opinions ... The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca . emissions laws involves three things I know of : 1 . All compliant diesels are turbocharged . 2 . All use an " aftercooler " , which cools the air which was heated by compression by the turbocharger ( up to about 25 PSI ) . 3 . A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air intake , and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is low . No scrubbers , catalytic converters , etc , are used . The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free . Interestingly , except for the low-pressure fuel limitation , power output and mileage are enhanced by these measures . One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power , lots more power , and these are approved by the CARB .

For the information of those not " lucky " enough to live in the city of Austin , TX , if an auto a / c system is checked and found to have leaks , it must be repaired at that time , or evacuated . This is an ordinance unique ( I think ) to the city of Austin . Freon is subject to increasing taxes , but $ 12 is about 2X cost here . Recovered freon is not required to be " purchased " from the car it is withdrawn from .
