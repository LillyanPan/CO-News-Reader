But what does it I would use the word " Christian " ( unqualified ) to describe someone to whom the above definition applied . BTW , it applies to me . [ deletia : Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a civil liberties issue , not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs and / or practices . ] I agree with Joe about this : if some group wants to believe in whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together and have group sex , or no sex , or sex only for the leaders ( but NOT with children ) , then , as much as I might believe them to be misguided , I think they should have the legal right . And I hope the investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any * legitimate * reason for going after Koresh in the first place ( before moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used ) . [ Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations . I'll ( provisionally ) accept this , unless someone has evidence to support the allegations ? ] Actually I wasn't thinking about the ( alleged ) child abuse , but about the reports that he had sex with , and fathered children by , several women in the cult . I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's beliefs and practices from specifically * Christian * perspective , not a civil liberties perspective . I think my question is not really aimed at Joe ( and possibly not at Ray Cote either , who seems to also be taking the political angle ) , but at Stephen Tice . - - | Steve Watson a . k . a . watson@sce.carleton.ca = = = Carleton University , Ontario | | this -> opinion = My.opinion ; assert ( this -> opinion ! = CarletonU.opinion ); | " Somebody touched me / Making everything new / Burned through my life / Like a bolt from the blue / Somebody touched me / I know it was you " - Bruce CockburnFrom : b645zaw@utarlg.uta.edu ( stephen ) Subject : Re : Comments on the Koresh 3-02 Transcript In article <1993Apr14.200259.20419@microsoft.com> , iank@microsoft.com ( Ian Kennedy ) writes ...

More along the lines of Hebrews 12:25- 29 , I reckon ... See that you refuse not him that speaks . For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaks from heaven : Whose voice then shook the earth : but now he has promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven . And this word , Yet once more , signifies the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remain . Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear : For our God is a consuming fire . Or 2nd Thessalonians 1:7- 10 ... And to you who are troubled rest with us , when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels , In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ : Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ; When he shall come to be glorified in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .

Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as we know it . LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh as a reminder . Seems that those who have been purified through salvation , or that those protected by the Seals , will be the ones who survive .

Sometimes it is good to know your > enemy , and if you want to do serious research you have to understand > both sides , and not solely the one and only right one . Yes , one does . I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by I think , Benjamin Franklin once , a Deist . I found it amazing that Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat . I also have the writings on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf , and it is amazing how much he missed . I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and Aristotelian Hylomorphesism . What a pile of junk . Jesus makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners . Psychology , the id , ego , superego by Freud ? Elements of truth , but Jesus explained it far better and gave reasons . Thomas Paine , Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson are mere men . They can screw up the Bible just as well as any man . I do not put these men on a pedestal . And if I remember T . J . ' s autobiography correctly , he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met . Here's some more circular reasoning to you . Paul says to the Corinthians that " that the gospel will be foolishness to the world , because it is spiritually discerned . " And so , people without the spirit of God haven't a clue to what the Bible is saying . From your point of view , that's incredibly circular and convenient . To me , it is mysteriously and supernaturally bizarre . I can see it , but you can't . This is not arrogance on my part . Trust me . It is as bizarre to you as it is to me . But nonetheless , it is a truth , explainable or not . Are any of you color blind to red and green ? I am . Remember those dot tests they do at the optomologist's ? They put pictures in front of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots ? If your eyes are perfectly normal , you can see letters or numerals embedded in the dots . They are a slightly different color and stand out from the background . But if you are color blind to red and green , you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots . That is how a dot test appears to me . I do not see a pattern at all . A normal seeing person will see the patterns . And to him , I seem like a total anomaly . To him , I appear as if I am missing the universe or something . It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything that to him is as plain as day . That it what it is like with the Bible , the Word of God , to the believer . The believer can see the meaning in the words . I can see how the patterns fit together . There is such depth . Such consistency . But then , on the other hand , I notice the non-believer . He doesn't see it . He thinks I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things . I look at him , and say , " No , you are weird . You do not see . " Then it is time for a sanity check . I go to another Christian and say , " Do you see this . " And they go , " Yes . It is an " X " " . And I say , " Thank God , I see the " X " too . " It is truly the strangest thing . It adds a little extra dimension to the phrase , " He will make the blind see , and the deaf hear . " I am glad that Jesus has enabled me to see . I wish every non-believer could see what they are missing .From : jmeritt@mental.MITRE.ORG ( Jim Meritt - System Admin ) Subject : Booze it up , thus sayth the Lord !

The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost every major Xian church there is . For centuries now . And still they stand . They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists , I am sure . They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison . One thing is known . A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons ! And the Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the Boobtist Witch-hunt .

Lev 17:11 : For the life of the flesh is in the blood , and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul . The Old Testament was very big on the " eye for an eye " business . It makes sense that Leviticus would support physical injury to " repay " moral wrongdoing . I know about sanctification . I've been taught all about it in Sunday school , catechism class , and theology classes . But even after all that , I still can't accept it . Maybe I'm still not understanding it , or maybe I'm just understanding it all too well . From the bottom of my heart I know that the punishment of an innocent man is wrong . I've tried repeatedly over the course of several years to accept it , but I just can't . If this means that I can't accept the premise that a god who would allow this is ' perfectly good ' , then so be it . > What ignorance you can show us next ? I guess I'll wait > till tomorrow .

The man-made laws are NOT working . " WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE ! " Perpetrators remain IGNORANT of The LAW--a universal , cosmic , and Spiritual Law--The " LAW of RETRIBUTION " or " KARMA " : " Be not deceived ; God is not mocked : for whatsoever a man soweth , that shall he also reap . " Galatians 6:7 , KJV . " He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity ; he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword . Here is the patience and faith of the saints . " Revelation 13:10 , KJV . " What goes around comes around . " This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical law that for every action there is an equal and opposite REaction . It is the ENFORCEMENT , the TEETH , behind The " GOLDEN RULE " : " Do unto others as you would have others do unto you . " ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in the future , most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION . Most victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past , usually during a PREVIOUS LIFE . What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators , in a convincing manner ( with sufficient supporting evidence ) , that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM , in this life or the next . Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION , and the related " LAW of Retribution " , should read books such as " HERE AND HEREAFTER " , by Ruth Montgomery , which describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation , including HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [ about 50 % accurate ; the subconscious mind can sometimes make things up , especially with a bad hypnotist ] , SPONTANEOUS RECALL ( especially by young children , some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives , homes , possessions , etc . ) , DREAM RECALL of past life experiences , DEJA VU ( familiarity with a far off land while traveling there for the first time on vacation ) , the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE , and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11- 13 ( John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias . ) and John 9:1- 2 ( How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born , unless he LIVED BEFORE ? ! ) . Strong INTERESTS , innate TALENTS , strong PHOBIAS , etc . , typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES . For example , a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE . And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT life , because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS INCARNATION . People would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be reaped by them in the future , or in a FUTURE INCARNATION !

Stop ! Hold it ! You have a few problems here . Official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi party , long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power . So this objection is a red herring , even if established history is wrong on this point . Moreover , none of the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm . A point I saw reiterated was that Hitler and the party covered up these accusations . If you are going to accuse official history of being a fabrication , you should at least get your facts right . The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in a coup against Hitler . Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of homosexuality as a pretext for the purge , nor as a justification afterwards ( it is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this , but I doubt it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his former right hand man was a homosexual ? ) . Anyway , as I said before , it is always possible that I have missed references to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false . Even the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage . In any case , this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 1920 ' s . > Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records , > anything bearing on the subject - - true or not - - has to be considered > tainted evidence . Ah , yes . I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy . I can smell the paranoia from here . Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with homosexuality ( at least , not according to what I've read ) , I'd like to know what tainted " evidence " you are talking about . Since the accusations were made by persons outside of the Nazi party , long before it came to power , and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 1920 ' s and 30 ' s , just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in time and plant " tainted " evidence ? How exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world , without the discrepancies being obvious ? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter do you know about ? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters , some of whom were not Nazis ? And what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it ? Since the point here seems to be to discredit established history , then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist . The revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations . Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts . > The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd , > the SA - - Sturmabteilung , " Storm Troopers " - - left the world a better > place when they departed , This is just about the * only * thing we agree on . I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people . The feeling seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality , that this must be an attempt to bash homosexuals . This fear - often justified - is what lies behind this distrust of official history , or so it seems to me . But this is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject . If you really think that historians are so incompetent , why don't you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject , if you can't tell from their footnotes ? I'm a graduate student in history . Writing to professors and tracking down sources is old hat . But my time is limited and this is not my specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence . I'm not going to waste my time trying to debunk someone's paranoia . Do the research yourself . > but concrete particulars are still no more than > more or less shrewd guesses . > - - Diccon Frankborn Given that you already consider all evidence " tainted " , what on earth would constitute concrete particulars ? And since when have concrete particulars been considered " shrewd guesses " ? I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians ( Irving et al ) - historians writing for a popular audience do not , as a rule , provide copious footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians , who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail . This is the place to start looking . Assuming that one really wants to know the truth . I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already .

You must be using ' values ' to mean something different from the way I see it used normally . And you are certainly using ' Science ' like that if you equate it to " the real world " . Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions .

I don't agree . Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate .

I don't see why . ' Usefulness ' in science is synonomous with ' accuracy ' - period . Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can't be shown to be accurate .

Ref : Encyclopedia of Religion , Mircea Eliade MAGI : [ Sneak Preview : Later still , eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions , as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes _ , a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era , probably the second century CE ( Widengren , 1968 ) . The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future ( Saoshyant ) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew _ ( 2:1- 12 ) . ] The Old Persian word magu , rendered in Greek by magos , is of uncertain etymology . It may originally have meant " member of the tribe , " as in the Avestan compound mogu-tbish ( " hostile to a member of the tribe " ) . This meaning would have been further resticted , among the Medes , to " member of the priestly tribe " and perhaps to " priest " ( Benveniste , 1938 ; Boyce , 1982 ) . The term is probably of Median origin , given that Herodotus mentions the " Magoi " as one of the six tribes of the Medes . For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran . Among the Persians , they were responsible for liturgical functions , as well as for maintaining their knowledge of the holy and the occult . Most likely , the supremacy of the Median priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the Great ( 550 BCE ) . The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political and civil institutions as well . Even if hypotheses have been advanced concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period ( Boyce , 1982 ) , we must still maintain that they were of Median origin . This is demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian , mentioned by Darius I ( 522-486 BCE ) in the inscription at Bisutun ( Iran ) , as well as by Greek sources . Indeed , Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi . The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions . This seems to be attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis . There is a theses , put forth by Giuseppe Messina , that denies that the Magi are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin . This thesis is untenable ; on the other hand , the hypothesis that their name is related to the Avestan term magavan , derived from the Gathic maga ( Vedic , magha , " gift " ) , is not without foundation ( Mole , 1963 ) . The meaning of maga can probably be found , in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition , within the context of the concept of purity , or separation of the " mixture " of the two opposed principles of spirit and matter . The maga , which has been erroneously interpreted as " chorus , " from the root mangh , which is said to mean " sing the magic song " ( Nyberg , 1966 ) and has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica , seems to be an ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision . In any case , though there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms magavan and maga , we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the Avestan priesthood . The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term , despite a recent hypothesis proposed by H . W . Bailey ; Old Persian inscriptions ignore the Avestan term for " priest , " athravan ( Vedic , athravan ) , even if this is perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis ( Gershevitch , 1964 ) . The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history ; the Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation . The latter in particular derives from an older form , magupati ( " head of the Magi " ) . During the Sasanid period ( third to seventh centuries CE ) , which saw the formation of a hierarchically organized church , the title mobadan mobad ( " the high priest of high priests " ) came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical hierarchy . The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage , or khvaetvadatha ( Av . ; Pahl . , khwedodah ) . They also performed a characteristic funeral rite : the exposure of the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it . The corpse was not supposed to decompose , lest it be contaminated by the demons of putrefaction . This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the Parsis in India . Stone towers , known as dakhmas , were built especially for this rite . During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was in vogue only among the Magi ; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with wax , then buried it . The practice was widespread , however , among the peoples of Central Asia . The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship : it was impossible to offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus . During the performance of a ritual sacrifice , the Magus sang of the theogony ( the Magi were possibly the custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry , but we know nothing about the relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta ) and was called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future . The Magi were also known for the practice of killing harmful , or " Ahrimanical , " animals ( khrafstra ) such as snakes and ants . They dressed in the Median style , wearing pants , tunics , and coats with sleeves . They wore a characteristic head covering of felt ( Gr . tiara ) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their breath ( Boyce , 1982 ) . The color of these caps , in conformity with a tradition that is probably of Indo-European origin , according to Georges Dumezil , was that of the priesthood : white . In all likelihood , during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in possession of a well-defined body of doctrine , and it is probable that they gradually adopted Zoroastrianism ; they were most likely a clergy consisting of professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally inclined to eclecticism and syncretism . Nonetheless , they must have been jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions . By virtue of this they were the educators of the royal princes . The wisest of them was responsible for teaching the prince the " magic of Zarathushtra , son of Horomazes " and thus the " cult of the gods . " Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just , courageous , and master of himself . During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great influence , although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor . Despite several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of Gaumata the Magian - in which , according to Herodotus ( who calls himself Smerdis ) , the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation - the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media , in Persia , and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration . No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi . They were renowned as followers of Zarathushtra ( Zoroaster ); as the teachers of some of the greatest Greek thinkers ( Pythagoras , Democritus , Plato ); as the wise men who arrived , guided by a star , at the manger of the newborn savior in Bethlehem ; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India . But they were also known as the Chaldeans , the priesthood of Babylon , known for its occultism ; this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek , like " goes , " " expert in the magic arts " ( Bidez and Cumont , 1938 ) . Indeed , the Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts , especially astrology , and had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge . To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views , it is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called western Magi , who were later hellenized . In the Achaemenid period both must have been at least in part Zoroastrian , but the western Magi ( those of the Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor , Syria , Mesopotamia , and Armenia ) , who came in contact with diverse religious traditions , must have , sooner or later and in varying degrees , been influenced by syncretic concepts . The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and , depending on their varying concerns , would emphasize one or the other aspect of them . Classical historians and geographers , including Herodotus and Strabo , document their customs , while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines : dualism , belief in the hereafter , Magian cosmology and cosmogony , and their theology and eschatology . Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus . In doing so they are repeating what the Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods , when they adopted Zoroastrianism . At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and placed themselves under his venerable name . Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those elements of the archaic religion that refused to die . It has been said quite often , in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the Zoroastrian tradition , that the Vendidad ( from vi-daevo-data , " the law-abjuring daivas " ) , part of the Avesta , should be attributed to them . ( This collection of texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and practices . ) Nonetheless , the hypothesis is hardly plausible , since the first chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda , the supreme god of Zoroastrianism , but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman ( Pahl . ; Gathic-Avestan , Angra Mainyu ) , the other supreme god and the ultimate source of all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran , Persia , or Media ( the land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana ) . Furthermore , it has been noted ( Gershevitch , 1964 ) that if the authors had been Magi the absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions , including their own priesthood , would be very strange . The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us , from the second half of the first millennium BCE on . This has been their principal merit . We can attribute directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed , known to us especially from Greek sources and , in part , from the Pahlavi literature of the ninth and tenth centuries CE . According to this formulation , the two poles of the dualism are no longer , as in the Gathas , Spenta Mainyu ( " beneficent spirit " ) and Angra Mainyu ( " hostile spirit " ) but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra Mainyu ( Gershevitch , 1964 ) . [ See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu . ] This trans - formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro - astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the Mesopotamian religious world . In this new dualism - which was that later known to the Greeks ( Aristotle , Eudemus of Rhodes , Theopompus , and others ) - we can see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism , to which we give the name Zurvanism . [ See Zurvanism . ] Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism , the Magi played an enormously important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings , as well as in the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically . Their natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora . The Greeks began to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them ( Xanthus of Lydia , Hermodorus , Aristotle , Theopompus , Hermippus , Dinon ) , even writing treatises on the Persian religion , of which only the titles and a few fragments have survived . In the Hellenistic period , the Magi were seen as a secular school of wisdom , and writings on magic , astrology , and alchemy were lent the authority of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra , Ostanes , and Hystaspes , forming an abundant apocryphal literature . ( Bidez and Cumont , 1938 ) . Later still , eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions , as can be seen in the famous _Oracles of Hystaspes _ , a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era , probably the second century CE ( Widengren , 1968 ) . The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of the Future ( Saoshyant ) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew _ ( 2:1- 12 ) . [ See Saoshyant . ] The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the religious history of Iran . Concerned to win back the western Magi ( de Menasce , 1956 ) , and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of Iran , the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to establish a true state church , strongly hierarchical and endowed with an orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures . The leading figures in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar and Kerder , the persecutors of Mani in the third century . SAOSHYANT : The Avestan term saoshyant ( " future benefactor " ; MPers . , soshans ) designates the savior of the world , who will arrive at a future time to redeem humankind . The concept of the future savior is one of the fundamental notions of Zoro - astrianism , together with that of dualism ; it appears as early as in the Gathas . Zarathushtra ( Zoroaster ) , as the prophet of the religion , is himself a Sao - shyant , one who performs his works for the Frashokereti , the end of the present state of the world , when existence will be " rehabilitated " and " made splendid . " [ See Frashokereti ] Later Zoroastrian doctrine developed this notion into a true eschatological myth and expanded the number of Saoshyants from one to three . All the saviors are born from the seed of Zarathushtra , which is preserved through the ages in Lake Kansaoya ( identified with present-day Lake Helmand , in Seistan , Iran ) , protected by 99,999 fravashis , or guardian spirits . The greatest of the awaited Saoshyants , the victorious Astvatereta ( " he who embodies truth " ) , the son of the Vispataurvairi ( " she who conquers all " ) , is the third , who will make existence splendid ; he appears in Yashts 19 . Upon his arrival humankind will no longer be subject to old age , death , or corruption , and will be granted unlimited power . At that time the dead will be resurrected , and the living will be immortal and indestructable . Brandishing the weapon with which he kills the powerful enemies of the world of truth ( that is , the world of the spirit , and of asha ) , Astvatereta will look upon the whole of corporeal existence and render it imperishable . He and his comrades will engage in a great battle with the forces of evil , which will be destroyed . The name Astvatereta is clearly the result of theological speculation ( Kellens , 1974 ) , as are those of his two brothers , Ukhshyatereta , " he who makes truth grow , " and Ukhshyatnemah , " he who makes reverence grow " ; the names of the three virgins ( Yashts 13 ) who are impregnated with the seed of Zarathushtra when they bathe in Lake Kansaoya and give birth to the Saoshyants , are equally speculative . Each of these Saoshyants will arrive at the beginning of a millennium , initiating a new age and a new cycle of existence ; Astvatereta will appear in the third and final millennium to save mankind . The doctrine of the future savior had already taken shape in the Archaemenid period ( sixth to fourth century BCE ) . It was not , perhaps the principal element in the formation of the messianic idea , but it was certainly a determining factor , one that enjoyed great success in the Hellenistic period beyond the confines of the Iranian world . A similar concept , that of the future Buddha , Maitreya , was most likely indebted to it , and Christian messianism can trace its roots to the same source .From : halat@pooh.bears ( Jim Halat ) Subject : Re : After 2000 years , can we say that Christian Morality is In article <1qjd3o$nlv@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de> , frank@D012S658.uucp ( Frank O'Dwyer ) writes : > Firstly , science has its basis in values , not the other way round . > So you better explain what objective atoms are , and how we get them > from subjective values , before we go any further . Atoms are not objective . They aren't even real . What scientists call an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes certain physical , observable properties of our surroundings . All of which is subjective . What is objective , though , is the approach a scientist takes in discussing his model and his observations . There is no objective science . But there is an objective approach which is subjectively selected by the scientist . Objective in this case means a specified , unchanging set of rules that he and his colleagues use to discuss their science . This is in contrast to your Objective Morality . There may be an objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on morality . But there exists no objective morality . Also , science deals with how we can discuss our observations of the physical world around us . In that the method of discussion is objective ( not the science ; not the discussion itself ) . Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes of what we can observe . It simply gives us a way to discuss our surroundings in a meaningful , consistent way .

S . threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion ' _ By Jeanne Huber , Mercury News Staff Writer HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose , flames leap up 24 hours a day from a gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States - dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions . With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land . " There is a fear - a real fear , too , " said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette . " We have one generation to do it or to die . " Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land . But for Zoroastrians , it is an especially poignant concern . Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years , a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where " historical sites " are sometimes less than 100 years old . It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius . And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later , he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests , the Magi . Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians , Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster , the Zoroastrian prophet . Yet , with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world , they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live . Survival as a people is very much on their minds . Ironically , local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians . Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion , and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts . So if their children become totally assimilated , they say , it's their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers . " It's important to have an identity , " said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose , a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India . " It's important for everybody - Irish , Scottish , Americans . It gives meaning to life . You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect . You can fall back on your own identity . " For Zoroastrians , there's much to be proud of . Their prophet , Zoroaster , seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common , preached that there was only one god , a good one . Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda , which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light . _Good vs . evil _ Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil , with the good eventually winning . Men and women could join in the battle for good , he said , and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong . He preached honesty , charity , kindness to animals , respect for the environment , hard work , equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions . But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly . He demanded they think for themselves . In fact , Joseph Campbell , the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths , traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians . Zoroastrians have many words for thought . Their motto , leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton , is " Good thoughts , good words , good deeds . " So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly . In India , where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran , Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy ; the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent . About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan , mostly to study at universities . The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights . Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on " good deeds " has improved life in every country they inhabit . In San Jose , the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi , a San Francisco-based hotelier , passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple . At the temple's dedication , the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta , the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra . The temple exists because of another good deed : the decision by an Iranian emigre , the late Arbab Rustom Guiv , to buy land for six temples in North America . Besides the 10 - acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton , he paid for land in Los Angeles , Chicago , New York , Toronto , and Vancouver . Until his gifts , there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent . Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple , and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center . The temple , dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet Zoroaster , is a simple structure with gleaming white walls , vaulted ceilings and oak floors , partially covered with huge Oriental carpets . Its central feature is the fire , set in the middle of a partly-glassed - in area at the center of the building . Although Zoroastrians are sometimes called " fire worshippers , " they actually consider fire just a symbol of God . " It helps us concentrate , just like Christians use the cross and Muslims use the Holy Book , " Bhujwala said . The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring . For all Iranians , including Zoroastrians , the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life . With Zoroaster's birthday just six days later , the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan . 1 . For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday , about 500 people came to worship and revel . " The good things in life are not forbidden , " Esfandiar Anoushiravani , a leader of the Iranian members , had said beforehand , and what followed proved him right . Inside the temple , worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood , glasses of milk and water , and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts . Kids crowded around , grabbing handfuls of the treats . " People eat the fruit , " Tarapore said . " It's a way to participate in the ceremony . " _Santa Claus , sort of_ The gathering even had a Santa Claus , Iranian style . With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children , this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring ) and red . He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown , Hajefyrouz , who danced and played a tambourine . The Zoroastrians from India were charmed . " This is all new for us , too , " one told a visitor who asked what was going on . A visitor , John A . Sabanovich of Folsom , said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran . Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result , some say , of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people's religion . But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can . " When I first heard about this religion , " he said , " I thought , my God , this is what a religion should be . They think for themselves and do good . " People who don't have a tradition , something to lean on , what's the difference with the lower animals ?

I had an ehum , interesting experience with the Rosicrucians , or at least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday . They had advertised that they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King - - the room of the heart ( which rhymes in Swedish ) . Out of curiosity , I went to the lecture . There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians , one woman and two men apart from me . The Rosicrucians were male , both of them . First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium Rosicrucianum , which was founded in Harlem , NL in 1925 . He read straight from a piece of paper , which I at that point was because he lacked experience in talking in front of people , but the other guy read , too , and he was used to holding speeches , I could tell . The first guy also said that the R : s are a mystical Christian order , and that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars ( English ? ) from the thirteenth century . The other guy took over , reading from his piece of paper in a fairy-tale teller's voice . What he said sounded like a load of crap to me . Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something . What made me a bit suspicious , was the way they first said that we all contained something divine , and could find our way back to divinity , then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently , but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss . Maybe I've read too much RAW , but it sounded very much like the things he talks about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your friends _ in _Prometheus rising _ . It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians . The one holding the actual lecture , obviously was top dog , and the other one seemed to be a true believer . I got the impression that the top dog had more distance to the faith than the true believer , that he used it to gain power and admiration .

A myth is more than a single story . The thought structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as important a part of the myth as the story itself . Thus , I can think of no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying thought structure , and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical " truths " along with it . randyFrom : kmr4@po.CWRU.edu ( Keith M .

Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence worshipped by the Persians . Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun , he is the lord of contract honor and obedience , therefore naturally worshipped by soldiers . He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct - antly agreed because of His obligation ... the blood of that bull spilled and grew all earth life ... then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat . Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians . Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman Pantheon ( tm ) for some semi-tricky reason , I forget why . But all references of Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same , so apparently His worship was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy , like membership in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc . The sociology of religion in ancient times is fascinating ! Oh , His B-day was 25 Dec . Ahem . I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the Roman Imperial God Roster or what . It contained mostly soldiers , with 7 levels of initiation . They worshipped underground in caverns in pews . The bull horns in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits , I'm not sure that they had Mithraic significance or not . I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the Christian masses . But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt . Someone mentioned bullfighting . Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls ? I forget . More likely , for a religious source , might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood ?

I do believe that homosexual sex is immoral , that does not mean I endorse using violence against them . There is a problem of hatred in the church . But there is also the problem of what has been called " unsanctified mercy . " Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in this country and the storm on the horizon , and have gotten militant in the flesh . This is truely sad . Yet others in other churches have embraced immorality in society , and have pointed to the carnality in the conservative churches to justify their actions . > Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people > to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away ? Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus . But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in .

I realize that it is not possible to penetrate such logic , but is there any chance that you might consider that an omnipotent god need not " attempt " anything , and further that an attempt to " reconcile " implies a lack of omniscience ?

God is God . But all humans are sinners , thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been punished with death . We aren't punished with sin now , of course , because God has changed . He required a brutal , sadistic sacrifice of his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death . > He cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in His midst . Yet he does so now . He has changed . The sadistic murder of his own son has made him more tolerant of our sins . Besides , his " midst " is everywhere , so your statement is meaningless . He tolerates sin in Hell , which surely is in his midst as well . Also , given that he is all-knowing , he must have eternal knowledge of who will commit which sins , as well as when and where , so what does tolerance have to do with anything . All of this is absolute nonsense , unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful , or unless he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you claim . > And the Israelites knew this !

Bit of a coincidence , that . Never lived out in the country I see . 4 years ago I had a place where I had to carry in propane every month , hook the bottle up to copper line , to supply both the stove , and a type of water - heater called a flash-heater . A flash heater has a pilot lamp . Here's the point . If the Davidians had their propane tanks hooked up to copper ( or some such ) lines , run through the ceiling spaces - - when the FBI started wrecking the place , they could easily have ruptured the lines . Which then would start spreading out through the overhead . And since it was a country home , it wasn't necessarily built with non-flamable insulation . It's probably more plausible than anything else , that the fire started mainly as a result of accident - - or willful negligence on the part of the FBI , which should have known better ( ie . manslaughter ) . It's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day - - the fire wouldn't have started . > Whatever the faults the FBI had , the fact is that responsibility > for those deaths lies with Koresh . Paul , what " fact ? "From : neese@cerritos.edu Subject : Hell In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words translated into the word " hell " . These Greek words have totally different meanings . The words are Hades , Tartaros , and Gehenna . In bibical usage , the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the New Testament , and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol ... meaning the grave or pit ( compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10 ) . Hades may be likened to a hole in the ground . ( In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire ! ) Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice . Why ? Because when seeing the word " hell " many readers impute to it the traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno , when this was never remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English ! In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of the dead , but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of " shadowy realm . " Hades is simply the abode we call the grave . All dead go to this hell . The second " hell " of the Bible , Tartaros , is mentioned only once in scripture , 2 Pet . 2:4 ; " For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell ( TARTAROS ) , and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment ... " Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne ( Isa . 14:12- 14 ; Rev . 12:4 ) , the archangel Lucifer ( now Satan ) and a third of the created angels ( now demons ) were ejected from heaven ( Luke 10:18 ) . They were cast down to Tartaros , a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment ( Jude 6 ; 1 Cor . 6:3 ) . Tartaros , then , is a " hell " that applies only to evil , rebellious angels or demons ( It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans ) . Nowhere in the Bible is there any mention of men being put into this particular " hell " . The the third word that is translated as " hell " in the Bible is Gehenna . It comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM , meaning " valley of Hinniom . " Hinnom is a deep , narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem . In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites , including infant sacrifice ( It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made their children " pass through the fire " to the god Molech . The rites were specifically celebrated in Tophet , the " place of abhorrence , " one of the chief groves in the valley ) . King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations . He defiled the valley , rendering it ceremonially unclean ( 2 Kings 23:10 ) . Later the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem ; a repository for sewage , refuse and animal carcasses . The bodies of dispised criminals were also burned there along with the rubbish . Fires burned continuously , feeding by a constant supply of garbage and refuse . Aceldama , the " field of blood " , purchased with the money Judas received for the betrayal of Christ ( Matt . 27:8 ) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom . So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell ? In Rev . 19:20 : the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working religious figure , the False Prophet , working with him will resist the re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming . Their fate is revealed by the apostle John : " And the beast was taken , and with him the false prophet ... These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone . " Where will this temporary lake of fire ( this " hell " ) be ? The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast : " For Tophet ( in the valley of Hinnom ) is ordained of old , yea for the king it is prepared , he hath made it deep and large , the pile thereof is fire and wood , the breath of the Lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it " ( Isa . 30:33 ) . One thousand years later , Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast ! ( Rev . 20:10 ) . But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia ? Does the Bible say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of fire ? In the sequence of Rev . 20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there ! ( Rev . 20:15 ) . What will become of these wicked ? Will they writhe in flames for eternity ? The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna fire on the earth . They wil be consumed , annihilated , destroyed ! This punishment will be everlasting ( permanent and final ) . The Bible calls it the " second death " ( Rev . 20:14 ; 21:8 ) , from which there is no possibility of a further resurrection . The Bible does teach eternal punishment , but not eternal punishing . The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description . " For , behold , the day cometh that shall burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do wickedly , shall be stubble , and the day that cometh shall burn them up ... " ( 4:1 ) . To the righteous , God says that the wicked shall be " ashes under the soles of your feet ... " ( Mal . 4:3 ) . Gehenna was a place of destruction and death , not a place of living torture ! Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or valley of Hinnom . Utter destruction by fire was complete . Nothing was left , but ashes ! Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means complete destruction , not living torture ( not eternal life in torment ) ! The Bible says , in Romans 6:23 , " The wages of sin is death " , not eternal life in torture . The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death ... the cessation of life . Eternal life is the GIFT OF GOD !From : pharvey@quack.kfu.com ( Paul Harvey ) Subject : Re : Jewish history question In article <cocoaC5uG2q.KsB@netcom.com> cocoa@netcom.com writes : > In article <1993Apr10.195513.17991@csi.uottawa.ca> misrael@csi.uottawa.ca ( Mark Israel ) writes : > > In article <cocoaC5797E.43y@netcom.com> , cocoa@netcom.com ( little ' e ' ) writes : > [ deleted ] > > > Here tis .

No . The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever built in the world . The Greeks had a love of wisdom , philo sophos , and this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library . The Christians got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling into Moslems hands ( far more likely since they were the book burners , not the Moslems ) , or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it . Either way , a tremendous amount of information was lost .

The argument by Jawad Ali is funny , He writes : " The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider Ahmadies to be Muslims " Which is a wrong statement . In the light of Dr . Ijaz's statement , the above statement should be corrected : " ... is that ( some ) non-Ahmadi Muslims don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims " So , the problem does not get solved :-) Who is a muslims and who is not ? Humans cannot decide . Humans may not declare others faiths . Its that simple . I don't understand , why the mere use of the word " ISLAM " is becomming such a big issue . I have seen numorous postings on the net on this subject , and all they say , " No , NO , you cannot use ISLAM as the name of your newsgroup " . ? ? I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring the name of other's faiths ? Who gives them this authority ? Quran ? or Hadith ? or something else ? I want to know this ! Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers , Did _EVER_ the Holy Prophet of Islam ( Muhammad PBUH ) , say to anyone who called himself a Muslim : No , You are not a Muslim ! ? ? ? NEVER ! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single such evidence from the history of Islam ! Hence , if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone , how could the Muslims , Mullahs or even Governments of today do it to anyone .

( 1 ) Stephen said you took a quote out of context ( 2 ) You noted that Stephen had not replied to some other t . r . m article ( call it A ) that took a quote out of context ( 3 ) But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the lack of X ( a common creationist error ) ( 4 ) So the fact that Stephen did not reply to A does not justify the conclusion that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A ( 5 ) You asked Stephen to explain why you were wrong and they were OK , or to acknowledge that he was being a hypocrite . ( 6 ) Both of the choices you give Stephen assume that he condoned taking quotes out of context in A . ( 7 ) I assumed you were being logical , and that the sentence that begins " Could you please explain ... " was not a nonsequitur , but was intended to follow from the sentence that preceded it . (8 ) Therefore , I concluded that you believed that ( 2 ) implied that Stephen condoned taking quotes out of context in A ( 9 ) But we've already seen that ( 2 ) does not imply this ( 10 ) Therefore , you were incorrect to believe that ( 2 ) implied that Stephen thought it was okay to take quotes out of context in A , and were making an error of a kind that is frequently made by creationists .

I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to take Mr . Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine . Hopefully the LDS netters will be amiable in their explanation . ) Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr . Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired ( I say " no good " because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the Creed were inspired ) , I leave you ( it will be some time before I post again ) with the following thought authored by Eugene England , Professor of English at Brigham Young University . Mr . England wrote the following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine ( Spring 1993 edition ): " I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon - - or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal , liberal or conservative ( Christian or non-Christian - - Hal 8 ^ ) . When we are tempted to draw a circle around a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American , then exclude those who don't fit , it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of a good American might be " one who doesn't draw exclusive circles " - - that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central American ideal is by excluding others . And when we are tempted to draw a circle around " Mormon " or " Christian , " to decide who is " orthodox " and who isn't by how much they agree with us , it might be well to consider that the central pillar of Christ's " orthodoxy " is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family . " I recently spent some time in a " Christian " bookstore in California . The service was excellent , the clerks and customers all smiling , neat , and well-scrubbed , and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries , sentimental fiction , and collections of evangelistic sermons . But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others , often viciously---whether the political left , our modern American culture , or other religions . A whole section was devoted to " Cults and the Occult , " and as you might expect , Mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment ( often by the same authors ) as Satanism . And I found I could either rent or buy ( in English or Spanish ) copies of The God Makers ( that absurdly inaccurate , even libelous , but very popular and dangerous anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s ) . " It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ( " Perfect love casteth out fear , " I John 4:18 ) . I have always been pleased that the LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths , though I find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive action---as the " religious right wing " has launched this year against the political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like . It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would , if they had power , forcefully restrict Mormons ' rights along with those of others they believe to be evil . " The above " sermon " was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People's magazine , but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms . Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ , the Church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the Church . I , for one , do not wish to be labelled " Christian " , if those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent ( for example ) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream Christianity would give it . Once again , being in the majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective voice is louder . That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the LDS Church ' interpretation ! Using someone elses biased research of truths and non-truths ( whose to say what the mixture is ? ) as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone , least of all themselves .

Anyways , cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong ( and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is PROOF positive that we are more advanced ) would have us believe . Cannibalism is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one alive . Many other cultures ( including many American Indian cultures ) eat / ate the flesh of slain enemies , often as a way of showing respect for the valor of the departed . Hearts are often favored for this , as it contains the spirit .

The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed , in part , as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if he has " ultimate responsibility .

And who is to say that this interpretation is " twisted " ? There are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way .

But these base commandments are too vague to serve as " a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems . " The meaning of these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular and cultural notions that the believer brings to them , from how the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of other Biblical passages , from a particular sectarian tradition , or from some combination of these things . These commandments lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for criticizing ethical systems .

Why don't I and the ( myriads of ) other Christians like me > tell you something about Christianity ? ... In a sense , the wide variety of interpretations does tell us something about Christianity . It tells us that the New Testament authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve as the source text for many , vastly different beliefs about the nature of the Christian god and about what men should and shouldn't do . The irony here is that there is * nothing * in Christianity per se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and gays . * Every * Christian principle he turns to this cause is effective only through the extra-Christian principles through which Michael interprets his religion , and the homophobes apply the * same * Christian principles , with equal justification , to their cause . In short , it is the extra-Christian principles that make Michael's Christianity beneficial , and I suspect they would be as beneficial , perhaps moreso , without being filtered by Christian interpretation . Michael paints a picture of " standard American atheism " as the rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian interpretations of the Bible . But I think it is even more damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and the nature of the good ( except , of course , when it is ordered by an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles ) . Here , I think we should apply a Christian parable , where a cold drink can have its value and a hot drink can have its value , but the lukewarm we should spit out . RussellFrom : kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ( Dr Nancy's Sweetie ) Subject : Re : Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among Southern Baptists . I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia , and I suppose that it might be useful here . Note that I do not necessarily agree or disagree with any of what follows : I present it as information . * For a short summary : a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity . ( Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity , and Mr Holly blames that on the Masons . ) The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department , which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ . A few years ago , they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry : they concluded that it was not a religion , and therefore was outside their speciality . However , Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry , and last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry . ( I got the feeling that they were saying " You got the wrong answer last time , try to do better and get the answer we want . " ) Anyway , there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions , but the dust has settled and the report is in . Nobody is entirely happy with it , but everybody seems willing to live with it . Both sides are saying things such as : " This was the best we were going to get in the current environment . " The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do , such as the hospitals and burn centers they operate , as well as efforts to help the elderly and prevent drug abuse . The report acknowledges that many well - known Christians are and have been Masons , and notes that many teachings of Masonry are " supportive of Christian faith and practice " . Examples of the latter include belief in God , emphases on honesty and integrity , and that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs . On the other hand , they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible with Southern Baptist principles . These included the use of titles which some people consider sacrilegious , the taking of certain oaths ( even though they are not meant seriously ) , the " undeniably pagan and / or occultic " writings of some Masonic leaders , the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation can be achieved by good works , and the racial discrimination practiced by many Masonic lodges . ( I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole aren't really in a place to speak on this last point . ) The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion , and says that membership should not be endorsed or censured , but left to the discretion of individuals . This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges , and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity , another may not . Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of the believer and the autonomy of the local church , and this history probably influenced how the report came out . * The information above was gleaned from " The Religious Herald " , a publication of the Baptist General Association of Virginia , and " Baptists Today " , which does not have any direct links to a religious organisation . ( Autonomy is a big issue among some Baptists . 8-) Because I have neither the report itself , nor whatever Masonic documents are relevant to these issues , none of the above comes with a guarantee . Your mileage may vary . Void where prohibited .

Mormons do , in fact , believe that all people , including Christ and Lucifer , are children of God in the sense that we were all created ( or organized or whatever ) by Him . We also believe that being " offspring " of God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually " born again " of Him . Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings .

Just curious , - - Rick Anderson librba@BYUVM.BITNETFrom : mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject : THE DIVINE MASTERS THE DIVINE MASTERS Most Christians would agree , and correctly so , that Jesus Christ was a Divine Master , and a projection of God into the physical world , God Incarnate . But there are some very important related facts that Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of , as are followers of most other world religions . First , Jesus Christ was NOT unique , John 3:16 NOTWITH - STANDING . There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master ( God Incarnate ) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES , a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY , both before and after the life of Jesus . The followers of some of these Masters founded the world's major religions , usually PERVERTING the teachings of their Master in the process . Christians , for example , added THREATS of " ETERNAL DAMNATION " in Hell , and DELETED the teaching of REincarnation . Secondly , and more importantly , after a particular Master physically dies and leaves this world , there is NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY alive . ( THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE UNIVERSES . ) Therefore , all those Christians who worship Jesus , and pray to Jesus , and expect Jesus to return and save them from their sins , are only KIDDING THEMSELVES , and have allowed themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly MANUFACTURED by the Romans . And emotional " feelings " are a TOTALLY DECEIVING indicator for religious validity . These things are similarly true for followers of most other major world religions , including Islam . Thirdly , the primary function of each Master is to tune His Initiates into the " AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM " or " SOUND CURRENT " , ( referred to as " THE WORD " in John 1:1- 5 , and as " The River of Life " in Revelation 22:1 ) , and to personally guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they are still connected to their living physical bodies by a " silver cord " . True Salvation , which completes a Soul's cycles of REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes , is achieved only by reaching at least the " SOUL PLANE " , which is five levels or universes above the physical universe , and this canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine Master . One such Divine Master alive today is an American , Sri Harold Klemp , the Living " Eck " Master or " Mahanta " for the " Eckankar " organization , now headquartered in Minneapolis , ( P . O . Box 27300 ; zip 55427 ) . Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji , now living in Punjab , India , and is associated with the " Sant Mat " organization . One of the classic books on this subject is " THE PATH OF THE MASTERS " ( Radha Soami Books , P . O . Box 242 , Gardena , CA 90247 ) , written in 1939 by Dr . Julian Johnson , a theologian and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of that time , Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji . Several of the Eckankar books , including some authored by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp , can be found in most public and university libraries and some book stores , or obtained thru inter-library loan . The book " ECKANKAR--THE KEY TO SECRET WORLDS " , by Sri Paul Twitchell , is ANOTHER classic . Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with the " Anti-Christ " , which is or was to be a temporary world dictator during the so-called " last days " . But the Masters don't ever rule , even when asked or expected to do so as Jesus was . People who continue following Christianity , Islam , or other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master , will CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation , between the Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world , until they finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine Master . RE-INCARNATION The book " HERE AND HEREAFTER " , by Ruth Montgomery , describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation as a FACT OF LIFE , including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past lives [ about 50 % accurate ; the subconscious mind sometimes makes things up , especially with a bad hypnotist ] , SPONTANEOUS RECALL ( especially by young children , some of whom can identify their most recent previous relatives , homes , possessions , etc . ) , DREAM RECALL of past life experi - ences , DEJA VU ( familiarity with a far off land while travel - ing there for the first time on vacation ) , the psychic read - ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE , and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11- 13 ( John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias . ) and John 9:1- 2 ( How can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born , unless he LIVED BEFORE ? ! ) . [ ALWAYS use the " KING JAMES VERSION " . Later versions are PER-VERSIONS ! ] Strong INTERESTS , innate TALENTS , strong PHOBIAS , etc . , typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES . For example , a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE . And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to another person being met for the first time in THIS life , because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS INCARNATION . The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF KARMA ( Galatians 6:7 , Revelation 13:10 , etc . ) . People would behave much better toward each other if they knew that their actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the future , or in a FUTURE INCARNATION ! " 2nd COMINGS " If a Divine Master physically dies ( " translates " ) before a particular Initiate of His does , then when that Initiate physically dies ( " translates " ) , the Master will meet him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul Plane . This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd Coming . It is an INDIVIDUAL experience , NOT something that happens for everyone all at once . People who are still waiting for Jesus ' " 2nd Coming " are WAITING IN VAIN . PLANES OF EXISTENCE The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of existence . Above the Physical Plane is the Astral Plane , the Causal Plane , the Mental Plane , the Etheric Plane ( often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane ) , the Soul Plane , and several higher Spiritual Planes . The Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN , ( counting upward from the Physical ) . The planes between ( but NOT including ) the Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes . It is likely that ESP , telepathy , astrological influences , radionic effects , biological transmutations [ See the 1972 book with that title . ] , and other phenomena without an apparent physical origin , result from INTERACTIONS between the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane . The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED . For example , a sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called " Hades " , and the Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it , created there LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a THREATENING manner . The Christian " Heaven " is located elsewhere on the Astral Plane . Good Christians will go there for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth . SOUND CURRENT vs . BLIND FAITH The Christian religion demands of its followers an extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more than GOOD FEELING ( which is TOTALLY DECEIVING ) . If a person is not HEARING some form of the " SOUND CURRENT " ( " THE WORD " , " THE BANI " , " THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM " ) , then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL CONTINUE . The " SOUND CURRENT " manifests differently for different Initiates , and can sound like a rushing wind , ocean waves on the sea shore , buzzing bees , higher-pitched buzzing sound , a flute , various heavenly music , or other sounds . In Eckankar , Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as a Member . This and other experiences ( such as " SOUL TRAVEL " ) REPLACE blind faith .

You are right that people read things differently in the Bible , and this is alright in parts like parables and such forth . However , when it comes to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs , there is only one correct way to read it . For example , either the doctrine of the Trinity is true , or it is false . Yes , people read the texts differently , but only one position is true . They both cannot be . According to the text , the doctrine is true and has always existed . Therefore , when people like Joseph Smith come along with a vision and thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the Bible , people consider him a cult .From : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Re : A KIND and LOVING God ! !

But my gut instinct says there is more at hand . It took some careful preplanning to demonize D . K . to such an extent .

Looking at [ 1 ] we find that during Roman times " Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period " ; that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop , eventually with 14 dioceses under it ; that " the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia " was the basilica built in Tyre ca . 314 ; that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware , wine , white marble , and dyed cloth ; that Tyre , along with other seaports , " provided outlets for South Arabian , Indian and even Chinese trade " ; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by " following a perpendicular , rather than horizontal , line of growth " ( because it was running out of land to build on ); that Tyre established colonies of its own . None of this sounds like a " small fishing village " by any stretch of the imagination . Centuries later , under the Abbasids , Tyre had " opulent and flourishing bazaars " and buildings of 5-6 stories . During this period , Tyre was " noted for its export of sugar , beads , and , as of old , glassware . " During the Crusades , Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks . ( There is a lot more , but I got tired of writing . ) In [ 2 ] we read the following description of modern Lebanon : " other * major cities * in Lebanon include Tripoli , Sidon , Tyre , Baalbek and Zahlah . " [ my emphasis ] This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War , and the Israeli military actions ( 1978 , 1982 ) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon . It notes that after Israel's withdrawel in 1984 , " Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy . " If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present , why is it always called a city ( or , above , a " major city " ) ? Why does it show up on all the maps ? When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given , why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list ( even if the list is only a dozen cities long ) ? [ 1 ] Philip K .

By modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town . A one-horse town ? Sounds like a lot of work for one horse . ( Anyway , Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland . They may even use cars these days . :-) The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says " Pop . ( 1982 est . ) 23,000 . " Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range . ( One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000 ; the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut , also , so I doubt that it is a typo . Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas . ) I don't doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades . In particular , the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit . > > After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200 ' s , I believe .

I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed . Don't most , if not all , of these apply not just to Tyre but to the other cities in the area ? Sidon , for example ?

From [ 2 ]: Tyre " receiv [ ed ] the rights [ of autonomy ] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy [ ed ] complete autonomy . She started a large series of coins , occasionally in gold ... " The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit your characterization , either .

Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler , arriving with many gifts in a city where various people live , will be welcomed by a representative of each people who acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language so , too , when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of Pre - and Post-Eternity ( Ezel and Ebed Sultani ) honored the universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the earth , and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from the realities of the whole universe , each species of creation - from water , rocks , trees , animals and human beings to the moon , sun and stars - welcomed him and acclaimed his prophethood , each in its own language , and each bearing one of his miracles . Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all his miracles . As the punctilious scholars have written many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood , here we will briefly point out only the general category into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted as accurate reports . The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad ( SAW ) fall into two main categories : The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal events that happened at the time of his birth , or before his declaration of prophethood . The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences of the prophethood , and contains two subdivisions : 1 ) Those wonders that were manifested after his departure from this world in order to confirm his prophethood , and 2 ) Those that he exhibited during the era of his prophethood . The latter has also two parts : 2.1 ) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest in his own personality , his inner and outer being , his moral conduct and perfection , and 2.2 ) The miracles that : related to substantial matters . The last part again has two branches : 2.2 . 1 ) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality , and 2.2 . 2 ) Those relating to matter and creation . This last branch is again divided into two categories : 2.2 . 2.1 ) The first involves the paranormal happenings that occured during his mission either to break the stubbornness of the unbelievers , or to augment the faith of the belivers . This category has twenty different sorts , such as the splitting of the moon , the flowing of water from the fingers , the satisfying of large numbers with a little food , and the speaking of trees , rocks and animals Each of these sons has also many instances , and thus has , in meaning , the strength of confirmation by consensus . 2.2 . 2.2 ) As for the second category , this includes events lying in the future that occured as he had predicted upon Allah ( SWT ) ' s instructions . Now starting from the last category , we will summarize a list of them . ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Unfonunately , I could not write as I had intended without choice , I wrote as my head dictated , and I could not completely conform to the order of this classification . - - - To be Continued Allah Willing .

The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly marked as officers and yelling " Police " repeatedly . This is used every day to bust drug houses . The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight . As for not knocking , it's a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight . Usually this strategy works ; if it didn't , then it wouldn't be used so commonly , now would it ? Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my point , since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear judgement on this issue . I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day . Furthermore , we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects . Do you suggest that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers's badges ? Just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects ? How far can they reasonably go to identiy themselves ? What do you suggest they can do which can't be faked by the " competition " ? Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops , that's not an excuse to murder police . In the case of the BD's , there was almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops . - - * Isaac Kuo ( isaackuo@math.berkeley.edu ) * ___ * * ___ / _o_ \ ___ * Twinkle , twinkle , little . sig , * (= =( / ___ \ )= =) * Keep it less than 5 lines big . * \= =\ / \ /= =/From : psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ( Robert Weiss ) Subject : [ lds ] Hal's reply In article <C51nLs.7As@boi.hp.com> , hall@boi.hp.com ( Hal Leifson ) writes ...

It isn't so much a matter of ' interpretation ' of Bible texts that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of * fabrication * . About 20 years ago , _National Lampoon _ had some comic strips in them that were drawn by Neal Adams . They were called " Son o ' God " comics . It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible . In the comic , there were a group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn , and when one of them said the magic word , he turned into " Son o ' God . " He went from a myopic , curly headed , yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied portraits of Jesus - - - with long flowing brown hair and gentile features . Now , if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus , and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this NatLamp Jesus , we would have to say that this was fallacious since this Jesus was a fabrication , and did not really exist . This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim that they are Christian . They profess faith in Jesus , but the Jesus that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the NatLamp Jesus was . = = = Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.eduFrom : markbr % radian@natinst.com ( mark ) Subject : Re : RFD : misc.taoism In article <1993Apr22.004331.22548@coe.montana.edu> uphrrmk@gemini.oscs.montana.edu ( Jack Coyote ) writes : > Sunlight shining off of the ocean . > The universe , mirrored in a puddle . > > Aleph null bottles of beer on the wall , Aleph null bottles of beer ! > Take one down , pass it around ...

Unless the FBI were to kill all publishers of the bible , it would seem the story of the seven seals would be bound to leak out .

You like those conclusions ? > I don't . I think that you are changing the meaning of " values " here . Perhaps it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word . value n . 1 . A fair equivalent or return for something , such as goods or service . 2 . Monetary or material worth . 3 . Worth as measured in usefulness or importance ; merit . 4 . A principle , standard , or quality considered inherently worthwhile or desirable . 5 . Precise meaning , as of a word . 6 . An assigned or calculated numerical quantity . 7 . Mus . The relative duratation of a tone or rest . 8 . The relative darkness or lightness of a color . 9 . The distinctive quality of a speech or speech sound . In context of a moral system , definition four seems to fit best . In terms of scientific usage , definitions six or eight might apply . Note that these definitions do not mean the same thing . In my mind , to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a reach . Science has its basis in observable fact . Even the usages of the word " value " above do not denote observable fact , but rather a standard of measurement . I would conclude that science does not have its basis in values , and so your statement above fails . In fact , if one concludes that a scientific set of measurements ( values ) are based on systems derived from observation , then it must follow that in a scientific context , there is no such thing as there is no such thing as " objective values . " Back to the present . This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow . Just because the word " values " is used in both contexts does not mean that there is a relationship between the two contexts . If one is to argue for objective values ( in a moral sense ) then one must first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective . Considering the meaning of the word " objective " I doubt that this will ever happen . So , back to the original question : And objective morality is ... ? If you can provide an objective foundation for " morality " then that will be a good beginning . > - - > Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' > odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by Evelyn Conlon ericFrom : drake+@cs.cmu.edu ( Drake ) Subject : Re : RFD : misc.taoism In article <1993Apr21.172806.679@megatek.com> tims@megatek.com writes : > > Let us not limit > > ' misc.taoism ' to ' philosophy ' . > > But if we don't limit it to * something * , the discussion degenerates into > a big amorphous glob .

Brian , have you checked out what your priests told you in the Bible to see whether they were telling you the truth ? Did you know that according to the Bible , there shouldn't even be such things as " priests " anymore ? Do you know why the preisthood was established in the Old Testament to begin with and the reasons why after Jesus , there were no priests--that is until the Roman Catholic Church 300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring the whole concept beyond the book of Hebrews ?

Superficially a good answer , but it isn't that simple . An awful lot of the starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic policies of the Western countries , as well as by the diet of the typical Westerner . For instance , some third-world countries with terrible malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce - - so that it can be fed to cattle in the US , to make tender juicy steaks and burgers . They have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans we encouraged them to take out . Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre idea ; instead , we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got . Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against Western infanticide . All the evidence suggests that so long as the children are dying in the Third World , we couldn't give a shit . And that goes for the supposed " Pro-Life " movement , too . They could save far more lives by fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against abortion . Hell , if they're only interested in fetuses , they could save more of those by fighting for human rights in China . And besides , Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this ethic against infanticide .

Hmm , it seems that this is the core of Christianity then , you have to feel guilty , and then there's this single personality that will save you from this universal guilt feeling . Brian , I will tell you a secret , I don't feel guilty at all , I do mistakes , and I regret them , however I've never had this huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder . If things happen wrong , I will try to learn from the mistakes and go on . This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain religious doctrines . And if your personality type is opposite , then you are not that easily attached to a certain world view system . > So do you see Jesus's point ? Christians are not perfect .

This brings up another something I have never understood . I asked this once before and got a few interesting responses , but somehow didn't seem satisfied . Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source . This might be a literary / historical question , but when I studied history I always looked for firsthand original sources to write my papers . If the topic was on Mr . X , I looked to see if Mr . X wrote anything about it . If the topic was on a group , look for the group , etc . If the topic is on Mr . X , and Mr . X did not write anything about it , ( barring the theistic response about the Bible being divinely inspired which I can't adequately argue ) , wouldn't we look for people who ate , worked , walked , talked , etc . with him ? If someone was at an event wouldn't they be a better " reporter " than someone who heard about it second hand ? I guess isn't firsthand better than second hand .

Robert Weiss writes [ a promise from Psalm 9:10 ] > Gee , since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical , you must be really > busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations ! He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy , again based on a lack of response to an article by Robert Weiss , toward Stephen . I pointed out that I did , in fact , agree that both Robert Weiss and Jim Meritt took quotes out of context . Hence , I find it difficult to understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite . Needless to say , I don't have time to reply to * every * article on t . r . m . that takes a quote out of context . I asked Jim the following : > } So , according to you , Jim , the only way to criticize one person for > } taking a quote out of context , without being a hypocrite , is to post a > } response to * every * person on t . r . m who takes a quote out of context ? Jim replied by saying > Did I either ask or assert that ? But today we find four articles from Jim , one of which has the subject " Silence is concurrence " : m23364@mwunix.mitre.org ( James Meritt ) writes : > Is it not the case that , in the eyes of the law , when someone is aware of > something and has the capability of taking action and does not , that individual > may be held responsible for that action ? Which is , of course , a complete red herring . Taking quotes out of context isn't a crime . I don't have time to read every article on t . r . m . , and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all . Does " silence is concurrence " imply that Jim thinks that because I didn't respond to Weiss ' articles I must condone Weiss ' taking quotes out of context ? Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this question ; read what he has written and decide for yourself . But back to the context of my conversation with Jim . Jim's next gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he concluded that I was being a hypocrite . I challenged him to provide the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion . Today we find another obscure article ( posting it twice didn't help make it more clear , Jim ) , titled " Inductive Logic " : > Scenario : > A white goose waddles past the door > A white goose waddles past the door > A white goose waddles past the door > ... ( repeat an uncountably large number of times ) ... > A black goose waddles past the door . An individual hits it with an axe . > > 1 .

If ONLY black geese are observed to be axed , is it not a valid question > to be concerned with the different behavior between black and white geese ? More red herrings . Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large number of my articles ? Could Jim mean that because I " axed " his articles , but not Weiss ' articles , he wants to conclude inductively ... Well , I can't see where he is going with this . But I can help him with his induction . I've written roughly 80 articles since January . The vast majority of them are discussions with Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists , where I take the position that they are making bad arguments . Some are discussions with Jim Meritt where I take the position that he is making bad arguments ( a straw man argument earlier , and taking quotes out of context more recently . ) Think hard about this Jim . See the pattern ? Think harder .

Is it their open diary--and they want to tell you something . And because they want you to know something , they make it very clear what they want you to know . They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric , but in simple straight-forward language . > I choose the > roads I travel , and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of > any given road or turn back - - and as long as I don't * always * turn > back , there's no shame in it . When I need help , I seek out my friends . You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible . You have chosen the road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that road doesn't look appealing to you . You rather build your own road . One that goes far away from that confrontation . But be assured of this , you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly . > And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying , either .

The story ends like this : " For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets , he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead .

And again with this new statement , you show more irrationality with regards to heaven . Jesus does tell you something of what to expect in heaven . Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him . Jesus does not expect you to placate either . Jesus wants you to willingly come to him , but not as his grovelling slave , but rather as his brother who will share in his glorious riches .

It is all meaningless in the end anyway . So go rob a bank . Go tell someone you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag . What's restraining you ?

I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way reduce its current usefulness . So long as it accurately predicts or describes things we can observe . Not to be a pain in the ass , but is there any reason you don't just say _the theory of evolution _ rather than the _fact of evolution is still a theory _ . I'm asking because this whole thread got started because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution _ , basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory _ . Without a clarification , like the one you just gave , just saying _the fact of evolution _ has a very different meaning to me . > > [ description of atomic theory , and alternative theories of gravity , deleted ] > > Both are very useful models that > > have no religious overtones or requirements of faith , unless of course you > > want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly > > the way the theory now formulated talks about it . > > Here is where you fail to make an important distinction .

The existence of these things > is so predictive as to be considered fact . The mechanisms , on the > other hand , are still worth discussing . I'm not sure I agree here . Again , it may be because I feel stronger about separating terms . I was trying to say that the _theories_ proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves are the only realities here . It is the existence of mechanisms , not the things themselves , that are so predictive as to be considered fact ( as you would say ) . There aren't really little planetary particle systems called atoms out there . Or I should say , and more to my original point , it would be a leap of faith to say there are , because we observe only the mechanisms . There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_ atoms out there as we have decided to think about them . It's enough to discuss the mechanisms . At any rate , I'm not sure I am being any clearer than before , but I thought it was worth a shot . The bottom line , though , is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas : 1 . - - evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence ( my way ) - - the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence ( your way ) 2 . - - creation is just an opinion . If a theist wants to call it a theory then he can . I won't : it has no supporting evidence and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can be made . With no mechanisms to talk about , there really isn't much to say .

I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a conviction . I am not certain what you mean by the " fundy " part as the term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses . If you refer to those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and wish to follow in his way , then I plead guilty . But what does it matter what I think . The Roman circus is over . The lions have been satisfied - - for now . The Emperor , after the long and gruelling struggle , sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down . With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh , I urge you to re-examine my previous posts . I believe you mistakenly assume that defense of Koresh ' right to his own personal beliefs and his right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh ' theology . Actually I understand little about the details of Branch - Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect of the tragic events of the past few days . Nor do I think Koresh ' sex life should be of any interest to the federal government . Of course Hillary says he had been molesting infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government ; they are state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having ever been levied against him . Under American law , he was innocent as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty . At least that's how it is suppposed to be . But he was demonized and propa - gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might bring upon him . But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children , who left the building in the early days of the siege , were carefully examined by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse and none was found . DeGuerin , one of the attorneys who met with Davidians several times before the conflagration , reported that the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse . Ultimately , Steve , what I think about the heart of David Koresh is quite unimportant . Today he is in the benevolent hands of a most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all . So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One who has all knowledge . Meanwhile , let's clean up the mess left on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the people it serves . - - Joe Gaut > > ( I remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire : I wouldn't > put it past Koresh to have torched the place himself .

We do them regardless . Kent Sandvik responds : > Hmm , it seems that this is the core of Christianity then , you > have to feel guilty . . . I think I see where you are coming from Kent . Jesus doesn't view guilt like our modern venacular colors it . " Feelings " have nothing to do with guilt . Feelings arise from the state of being guilty . Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive . Feelings are a reaction from guilt . Jesus is talking about the guilt state , not the reaction . Let me give you an example : Have you ever made a mistake ? Have you ever lied to someone ? Even a little white lie ? Have you ever claimed to know something that you really didn't know ? Have you ever hated someone ? Have you ever been selfish ? Are you guilty of any one of these ? The answer is of course , YES . You are guilty . Period . That is it what Jesus is getting at . No big surprise . Feelings do not even enter the picture . Consider Jesus's use of the word " guilt " as how a court uses it . Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being imperfect . The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners . We all do bad things . Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our guilt that we are all sinners . It is it in our nature to do bad things . We are sinners , therefore we do bad things . Being a sinner is fact . It is not a pleasant fact . But it is just a fact . We are not perfect . Calling us sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a human being . Guilty as charged . > and then there's this single personality that will save you from this > universal guilt feeling . You can handle your guilt in one of two ways : Acknowledge you made a mistake , learn from it , and try to not do it again--in the meantime , not punishing yourself for it : which is the way Jesus wants you to handle or it . This is the healthy way . Or two , the destructive way : put yourself down , slap yourself and feel like crap , never forgive yourself , force yourself to say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide . This the way Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it . All people fall into this category to some extent in their lives . Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt feeling . Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he loves us despite our guilt . Jesus knows we are guilty . That isn't new to him . It is no big deal to him . He just wants you to realize that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him . That is what he wants you to know . Why , because he wants to have your company . You are immensely valuable to him . Jesus wants a relationship with you , however , in our present sinful nature , we are incapable of having this relationship . God is perfect . We are not . You cannot fit a square peg into a round hole . However , God has provided a way for us to change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him . God has provided Jesus , so that whosoever just believes in Jesus , will have their nature changed . The Holy Spirit will move it . And now divine nature is now within lives our very being--and us and God communicate with each through his unifying Holy Spirit . The benefits of this are endless . For with the divine nature living within us , we can now see our imperfections better . We can now head them off at the pass . With the power of the Holy Spirit living in us , we now have his power to help us overcome our shortcomings . Because the divine nature lives within us , we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before we could understand . Because the divine nature now lives within us , we now have authority over demonic forces . And lastly , because the divine nature now lives within us , we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit is eternal . The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance . Because it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to heavenly kingdom , it is your relationship to the living God . Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he separated the " goats from the sheep " . Many people in the last day will ask him , " Didn't I prophesy in your name and do miracles , and do good things in your name ? " And what did Jesus say ? " Depart from me , for I never * knew * you . " That is the cornerstone of Christianity , Kent . Jesus must know you as his friend . It is your relationship to Jesus . If he is your friend and you are his , you will be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven . > Brian , I will tell you a secret , I don't feel guilty at all , > I do mistakes , and I regret them , however I've never had this > huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder . Good . It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you love yourself . That is the second greatest commandment Jesus taught . If only more people could do as you do . As I said before , in the common english venacular , " feeling guilty " has a different meaning than the state of guilt . > This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain > personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain > religious doctrines .

" Come to me , take my yoke upon your shoulders , for my burden is light . " A yoke is used to direct oxen to do work . Once you have a relationship with Jesus , you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life .

What is the source of this pseudo-doctrine ? Who is > the pseudo-teacher ? Who is the Great Deceiver ? OK , here's at least one Christian's answer : Jesus was a JEW , not a Christian . In this context Matthew 5:14- 19 makes sense . Matt 5:17 " Do not think that I [ Jesus ] came to abolish the Law or the Prophets ; I did not come to abolish , but to fulfill . " Jesus lived under the Jewish law . However , He was the culmination of the promises of the Prophets . He came to * fulfill * the prophecies and fully obey God's purposes . Verse 18 says " For truly I say to you , until heaven and earth pass away , not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law , until all is accomplished . " The key to this verse IMHO is the last phrase . Jesus , as the fulfillment of the law , " accomplished " what the Law was supposed to accomplish . Verse 19 : " Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments , and so teaches others , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but whoever keeps and teaches them , he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . " Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish people about living lives under the law , this makes sense . In general , it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he must have received about " doing away with the Law . " That was not Jesus ' intent at all . He had come to earth to live the Law as it should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his people all the way back to Eve [ Gen 3:15- The serpent will bruise your heel , but * He * will bruise his head . ] Jesus appeared to be " doing away with the Law " because he did not honor the traditions of men as equal to the Law of God . He regularly locked horns with the religious leaders of the day because he would not conform to * their * rules , only God's Law . In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law and defending himself against his accusors . Almost the entire Sermon on the Mount ( Matt . 5-7 ) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people understand the true intent of the Law , sweeping away the clutter which had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions . In Galatians 3:23- 26 , Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the Law in this way : [ 23 ] But before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , being shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed . [ 24 ] Therefore the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ , that we may be justified by faith . [ 25 ] But now that faith has come , we are no longer under a tutor . [ 26 ] For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus . I believe this says that after Christ was revealed , the Law had served it's purpose , i . e . " our tutor to lead us to Christ , " and now , " we are no longer under a tutor . " The law has been " fulfilled " as Christ said he would do . God , the author of the old Law , and the Christ / Man , Jesus , are the same personality . Therefore , the old Law and the new Testament ( the " last will and testament " of Jesus ) are based on the same moral principles . It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are re-expressed in Christianity . On the other hand , now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and Christians relate to God through Christ , not the Law , it also makes sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to represent the " mysteries " of this new relationship . i . e . Baptism representing Christ's death , burial , and resurrection ( Rom . 6:3- 8) , The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice ( I Cor . 11:26 ) , and Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection ( Matt 28:1 ff , Acts 20:7 ) OK , That's one Christian's explanation . I don't claim to have all these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome other Christians to offer other alternatives . Please excuse the long posting .

We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil rights . Among these are drug abuse , sexual perversion , and political incorrectness . Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants . He had been accused of a number of differing crimes ( inconsistantly ) over the last two months , but this is the first time I have heard that one . I had heard child abuse but this is somewhat stronger . It is fairly obvious that Koresh was hiding behind the children ; and ironicly considering his apocalyptic dread , believed enough in the American People's inherent goodness to believe he was protected . It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal , crazy , a child abuser and a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons had said . Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found that they have screwed up . But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost .

The passage has * nothing * to do with the subject matter in which > it lies . It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears . I think this is a weak argument . The fact is , there are * two * references to Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews _ , one of which has unquestionably at least been altered by Christians . Origen wrote , in the third century , that Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah , while the long passage says the opposite . There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the Jews _ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho for Jesus and may be authentic . There is no question that Origen , in the third century , saw a reference to Jesus in Josephus . There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which lack the references . It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted , but I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in the scholarly community that this is the case . ( I know G . A . Wells takes this position , but that's because he takes the very small minority view that Jesus never existed . And he is a professor of German , not of biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to the historicity of Jesus . ) Jim Lippard Lippard@CCIT.ARIZONA.EDU Dept . of Philosophy Lippard@ARIZVMS.BITNET University of Arizona Tucson , AZ 85721From : emarsh@hernes-sun.Eng.Sun.COM ( Eric Marsh ) Subject : Re : What RIGHT ?

" Humans are in a state of tension , a tension of opposites . Good and evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind . The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being . The warring opposites within us are a product of man's rebellion against God , which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures . Man was created with the order to become a god . Those were the words of St . Basil in the fourth century . What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature . In the Eastern Orthodox Church , this is called " theosis , " or " deification . " One can also say that man was created to be whole , i . e . spirit , soul , and body operating in unison . The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness . Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other , the world , and the Creator . That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God , their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves . Immediately , guilt and fear was manifested in their lives . They become bound to hardship , toil , and suffering . This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state . The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness . If it were to receive this self-awareness , the knowledge of good and evil , its paradisiac state would also be destroyed . Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth ? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God , who did not desire that His masterpiece , mankind , be a blissful idiot ? God must have known that , for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value , he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites . There is no other way to achieve union with God . Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities . He was the perfectly integrated individual , reconciling the opposites , and making it possible for us to be integrated , i . e . to become God , not in His essence , but in His energies . The opposites is THE Christian problem . The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15- 24 . And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25 .

Bill , I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is probably the weakest evidence . What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out by the Jewish councils in the second century . There are enormous quantities of detailed arguments against Christianity , many of the arguments still being used today . Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity , not one denies the existance of Jesus , only of his activities . I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the gospels ( especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a source ) . | __L__ - | - ___ Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub | | o | kv07@iastate.edu | / ` - - - ' Iowa State University / | ___ Math Department | | ___ | 400 Carver Hall | | ___ | Ames , IA 50011 J ___From : lowell@locus.com ( Lowell Morrison ) Subject : Re : Freemasonry and the Southern Baptist Convention In article <1qv82l$oj2@usenet.INS.CWRU.Edu> ch981@cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Tony Alicea ) writes : > > > With the Southern Baptist Convention convening this June to consider > the charges that Freemasonry is incompatible with christianity , I thought > the following quotes by Mr .

Well , suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was sent towards a black hole . As it got closer to the event horizon , the red shift would keep increasing .

TRANSLATION The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material nature . O Arjuna , become transcendental to these three modes . Be free from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety , and be established in the self . PURPORT All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three modes of material nature . They are meant for fruitive results , which cause bondage in the material world . The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane . Arjuna , as a student and friend of Lord Krsna , is advised to raise himself to the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where , in the beginning , there is brahma-jijnasa , or questions on the supreme transcendence . All the living entities who are in the material world are struggling very hard for existence . For them the Lord , after creation of the material world , gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get rid of the material entanglement . When the activities for sense gratification , namely the karma-kanda chapter , are finished , then the chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the Upanisads , which are part of different Vedas , as the Bhagavad-gita is a part of the fifth Veda , namely the Mahabharata . The Upanisads mark the beginning of transcendental life . As long as the material body exists , there are actions and reactions in the material modes . One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities such as happiness and distress , or cold and warmth , and by tolerating such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss . This transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna . Bhagavad-Gita As It is Books of A . C .

It's similar to collecting coins , or stamps , or campaign buttons , or coke bottles , or juke boxes , or model trains , or just about anything else that is collected ( and just about everything is collected ) . In all cases , you might consider it something of an aberration ; I mean , what purpose does it serve ? Not much really ; it's just a hobby . The collector yearns for diversity ( not much use in having TWO of the same thing , except for trading / selling it ) , historical significance ( this was the thingy used by so-and-so ) , technical significance ( this is the only one that does such-and-such like this ; this is the first one to do it this way ) , rarity , and so on . Some people use their collections , other people do not . As you state , you use your collection . In one sense , this diminishes the value of your collection as the items suffer wear and exposure . In another sense , it can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection . Some people collect firearms that they do not use ; other people use some or all of the firearms they collect .

The problem is , your use of the word " objective " along with " values . " Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective , that is they are particular to a given individual , or personal . You see , what one person may see as worthwhile , another may see as worthless . > If on the other hand , some things * have * objective worth , usefulness , > or importance , it would be interesting to know what they are .

Alternatively , you could try to > demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful , worthy > or important in any situation . In other words , I need to know > how you use the term " objective " . When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of that word given by another person , I try to find a standard against which to judge that usage . In most cases , the dictionary is the standard I use . Here is a definiton of objective : objective ADJ . 1 . Of or having to do with a material object as distinguished from a mental concept . 2 . Having actual existance . 3 . a . Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice . b . Based on observable phenomenon . By this definition , science does not have an objective worth , since the phrase " objective worth " is an oxymoron . However you asked something a little differently this time , you asked for an objective basis for a notion . The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is responsible for changes in our world ( the changes are material , and thus " objective " ) would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument . However , the conclusion arrived at from that argument ( that science is " good " ) is subjective . I think that the problem here is one of word usage . Take a little time and read the definitions of these words : objective , subjective , worth , value , morality , good , evil . I believe that if you think about the meaning of them for a while , you will have to conclude that there is no such thing as an objective morality . > Frank O'Dwyer ' I'm not hatching That ' > odwyer@sse.ie from " Hens " , by Evelyn Conlon ericFrom : daveb@pogo.wv.tek.com ( Dave Butler ) Subject : Re : NEW BIBLICAL CONTRADICTIONS [ still not ] ANSWERED ( Judas ) Mr DeCenso , in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas , rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases those scholars opinion on the subject : > ... we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records > his death .

It is , > however , highly probable . ^ ^ ^ and > Also , there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure . It simply > means " hang oneself " . Actually , if you do further research as to the Greek word " apacgw , " you will find that it does denote success . Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful . As I pointed out , I recently checked several Lexicons : " Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament , " Louw and Nida " Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament " " Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament , " Grimm " Word study Concordance , " Tynsdale " A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian Writings , " Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich " The New Analytical Greek Lexicon , " Perschbacher A couple simply stated " hanged oneself " , and a couple were more explicit and stated that " apacgw " means specifically " kill yourself by hanging . " A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for " apacgw " is " strangle , throttle or choke " ( which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down ) . One of the best references though , " Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament , " not only stated the translation , it gave both the root words , the literal translation , related greek words which use the same roots , and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature ( to give further context ) . The word " apagchw " has two root words : " gchw " is the " to strangle " root , and the root word " apo " means literally " away . " This root words is included in words which denote a transition . It can mean a transition in place ( eg : the greek word " apagello " means to send a message ) . " Apo " can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death . Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word " apokteiuo , " which means " to kill . " In literal meaning the word " apacgw " means " to throttle , strangle to put out of the way , " and implicitly denotes a change in life state ( ie : away from life , to death ) . So while the word " apacgw " does mean " to hang , " it specifically denotes a death as well . Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means " to hang oneself , to end one's life by hanging . " He then notes the the use of " apacgw " in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context . He presents that example of " apacgw " as being used to explicitly mean " suicide by hanging . " Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling , without the added denotation of " death , " and as you insist that the Bible was written by God , and every word is precicely correct , you are stuck with the complete meaning of " apacgw " ( ie : Since the word " apacgw " was used , then death is denoted as the result ) . By the way , I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of " apacgw " : > In the Septuagint ( the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus ) , > it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : " Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice > was not followed , he saddled a donkey , and arose and went home to his house , > to his city . Then he put his household in order , and hanged himself , and > died ; and he was buried in his father's tomb . " ^ ^ ^ > ^ ^ ^ > Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel " hanged himself " [ Gr . Sept . , > APAGCHO ] , but it explicitly adds , " and died " . Here we have no doubt of the > result . > In Matthew , we are not explicitly told Judas died . Note Mr DeCenso , as you say , the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek , and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew ( ie " the the Hebrew say " and died " ) , and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek . It should also be pointed out that , regardless of the added " and died " , the correct translation would still be " apacgw , " as the man did indeed die from strangulation ( redundant , but correct ) . Further , we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited ( which included versions which contradicted each other ) , and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks . Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands , as a paragon of ancient greek . So , what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso , is an example , in ancient greek , of someone committing " apacgw " and surviving . Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence . Now I would note Mr DeCenso , that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis , I pretty much find it false . Thus , I think that if you are going to add to the text , something over and above what the source clearly says , then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it . By the way , as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field : > There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom . Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old , or that there are 2000 year old stumps there , or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees , then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago ( after all , things change ) . Now as to your other argument , ie : that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers : > As to your second question Mr DeCenso , you ask how we could be sure that the > money with which Judas purchased the land , was indeed for the betrayal , rather > than some other source . I would point out that in Acts , where it specifically > mention " the reward of iniquity " [ Acts 1:18 ] , it also specifically mentions > what act of iniquity they were talking about ( ie : Acts 1:16 " ... concerning > Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus . " ) . Now I would point out > that when the Bible describes an act of " iniquity , " and then immediately > discusses " * the * reward of iniquity , " it would be rather inane to suggest that > it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed . " > > > Notice that in verse 16 , the word " iniquity " is not used . Rather , it states > that Judas " became a guide to those who arrested Jesus " . > But the writer DID NOT stop there ... vs . 17 , " for he was numbered with us and > obtained a part in this ministry . " What part did Judas play in their ministry ? > ^ ^ ^ True , Peter ( or the author of Acts ) does not specifically call Judas ' betrayal " an iniquity , " but for that matter , neither does John specifically call Judas ' actions " an iniquity " either . Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took the money box , but rather said : " Some thought that because , Judas had the money box , Jesus was telling him " Buy what we need for the feast " ; or that he should give something to the poor , So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out , and it was night . " Note that it is said that Judas left , it does not say that he took the money box . Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity , mentioned by another author , in a different book , written at a different time , over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts . I find this forced and contrived . Of course this particular argument becomes moot , since we have have seen evidence that " apacgw " means suicide . You see , since Judas ' hanging was successful , he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29 , because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day ( ie : Passover ) , and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day . Thus the money which bought the " Field of Blood " would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver ( Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well , and thus couldn't have spent that either . Oh dear , I believe that the house of cards is comming down ) . Maybe we should at this point , discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas . By the way , as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from ( ie : the mention of it in Matthew ) , you say : > Please , when we are done with this study on his death , remind me to discuss > this with you . I am reminding you now to discuss it now . It's all part of the same verse we are discussing , and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues . Later , Dave Butler A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence . David Hume , Philosopher An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding PS .

Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate from your own reference frame . There's no inside and no outside , there are just two polarized views . As for statements inside the Bible , things are still not that clear , we don't have any indications for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament , one of the few books that actually talks about Satan . Jobs is very much out of line with the rest of the OT books , and there's a chance that someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures . > Now in your sense , Kent , of sensing reality--that is a different > matter .

This operates the other way around as well . You have to understand the mind of an atheist , agnostic , or as in my case , a radical relativist . If you don't understand the underlying concepts , it is pretty hard to continue with a dialogue .

For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large they have no compunctions about printing lies , half-truths and misleading innuendos as part of their exposes .

Given the record of American Christianity , any group that falls into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically into the Inquisition business . It is an unavoidable affliction of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth ( tm ) . And let's not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod Lutherans , and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers .

In actuality it is " chorion " , which is the last word Acts > 1:18 . Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss " chorion " so I > cannot report as to the nuances of the word . I abhor publishing trash ( I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others , but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject , I do not feel dishonest , though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example ) . Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word . First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed ( it is not nontrivial by any means , and I still am not competent with it , but it is not as opaque as I had thought ) . It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich " Greek Lexicon " renders each verse in order , each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order . Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable , the syntax is far from clear . On the other hand , a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable . And yes , the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed " chorion . " Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons : " Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament , " Louw and Nida " Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament " " Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament , " Grimm " Word study Concordance , " Tynsdale " A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other early Christian Writings , " Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich " The New Analytical Greek Lexicon , " Perschbacher In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as : A space , place , region , district , field , area , " country place , " land , farm , estate , " a bit of tillage " , and similar meanings . Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about " grave . " As some of these books go into great detail , I would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek . I think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into " contradictions " to be once again , as your friend said it , " lacking in substance , " and thus Archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness ( By the way Mr DeCenso , I would have honorably presented my results on this matter , even if I had found them to support Mr Archer's contentions ) . By the way , among these lexicons , ( eg : Robinson's ) is the definition of " agros , " the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought . The word " agros " is defined as " a field in the country . " Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros . This is significant , as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger's exegisis was , which stated that the word for " field " in Matthew ( ie : agros ) is different from the word for " field " in Acts ( ie : chorion ) , and thus we must be talking about two different fields ( Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is , but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home ) . So as of now , unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise ( eg : a reputable scholar with reputable references ) , I consider this particular issue closed . See Mr DeCenso , now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter , the day of the Crucifixion , Tyre , and the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the " Potter's Field .

There's another point to be made . Those who have been inside burning houses know that if they want to stay alive , it's better to run out from the building . We had one case where an FBI agent * had to drag out a women * from the burning house , she run back in when she saw the forces arriving .

By the way , I enjoy science . > It is truly a wonder observing God's creation . Macroevolution is > a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [ guaranteed > within three percent error :) ] Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point , sentence by sentence . 1 ) We are talking about origins , not merely science . Origins of what ? Are we speaking of the origins of life , the human species , the universe , physical law , biological diversity or what ? 2 ) Science cannot explain origins . This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified . It depends on what origins we are talking about . 3 ) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth than science . Again , this is a false statement . To begin with , the notion of " higher truth " is distinctly dubious . Many people believe that there are ways to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science ; they even believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain . Many believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language of science . Let it be so . These truths are neither " higher " or " lower " ; they are simply true . More to the point , restricting one's discussion of origins to science does not reject other sources of knowledge ; it simply restricts the scope of discussion . 4 ) This is a false premise . If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false then ( 4 ) is actually true . However the context identifies it as another false [ or at least theologically unsound ] statement . 5 ) By the way , I enjoy science . On the evidence Mr . Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science to enjoy science in any meaningful sense . One might just as well say that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read . However one cannot mark this sentence as false - - to follow the analogy , perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters . 6 ) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation . Let us not quibble ; count this one as true . 7 ) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [ guaranteed within three percent error :) ] Still another false statement . However one can make it come out true with the following contextual modification : " Macroevolution , as misunderstood by Rawline , is a mixture of 15 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science , and 85 percent of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion . " - - - It is distinctly noticeable that Mr . Rawlins fails miserably to touch on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels . [ I do him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his personal reactions . ] One can account for this by the hypothesis that he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth . - - Richard Harter : SMDS Inc .

First and foremost , I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago . I know your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did , but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has any bearing on this universe or the lives in it , and I similarly do not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed . Period . I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a ' cultural virus ' that has been passed down from generation to generation because people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim responsibility for their own fate , so they brainwash themselves and their children into believing the popular myths , and it goes on from there . And eventually Christianity becomes a given - - if so many other people believe in it , it must be right , no ? I don't believe in any " life after death " . I believe that when I die , I die , so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose to my life in the meantime . I don't believe that it's a good thing to humble myself and view pride as a sin - - pride , in moderation , is a constructive thing . I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and nothing inferior about women , and my priests lost a lot of my trust when they patronizingly tried to explain the ' faults ' of these opinions to me . I don't believe in ' loving everyone ' , especially people I've never met ; while I try to show respect to everyone , my love and admiration is something not easily earned , and I do not feel guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has abused it . If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously , stop trying to show me how the Bible " makes sense " .

I respond . The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise before entering into heaven . No one has made a point for or against that issue , nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox belief . The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom ( Luke 16 ) , the place of the righteous dead in sheol ( equivalent to hades ) . The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent on their death bed . Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was contradictory to what John's position put forward . The thief on the cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise , the abode of the righteous dead . John's position possibly needs to be reworked .

Have you considered Josephus , the Jewish Historian , > who also wrote of Jesus ? In addition , the four gospel accounts > are very much in harmony . Bill , I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert . By biblical scholar I mean an expert who , in the course of his or her research , is willing to let the chips fall where they may . This excludes literalists , who may otherwise be defined as biblical apologists . They find what they want to find . They are not trustworthy by scholarly standards ( and others ) . Why an insert ? Read it - I have , a number of times . The passage is glaringly out of context , and Josephus , a superb writer , had no such problem elsewhere in his work . The passage has * nothing * to do with the subject matter in which it lies . It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears . Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about the Josephus insert , your " proof " is meaningless and it should not be repeated here . What's more , even if Josephus happened to be legitimate , it would " prove " nothing . Scholars speak of the " weight of evidence . " Far more independent evidence would be required to validate your claim . Until forthcoming , your belief is based on faith . That's OK , but you exceed your rights when you pass faith off as fact . As for the gospels , there are parallels , but there are also glaring inconsistencies and contradictions . Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect ? Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate ? I suggest you read _Gospel Fictions _ by Randel Helms , and _The Unauthorized Version _ by Robin Fox ( for Herb Huston , no known kinship or familial relationship , but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry ) . The fact that there are inconsistencies , gaps and contradictions does not deny your position . On the other hand , neither do the gospels " prove " your faith . Independent evidence is necessary , and I know of none ( which we have already discussed , and so far you have not provided any ) . Until then , its faith . Moreover , you have committed a fundamental error in logic . You have attempted to " prove " your claim with that which you want to prove . Its no different than saying " I am right because I say so . " Your logic is full of circles . It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian General Assembly . The assembly defined five fundamentals ( this is where " fundamentalist " came from ) of orthodox Protestant Christianity , to wit : 1 ) Jesus performed miracles , 2 ) Jesus was born of a virgin , 3 ) Jesus was bodily resurrected , 4 ) Jesus ' crucifixion atoned for human sin , and - here is the clincher - 5 ) the bible is the inerrant word of God . Presbyterians construe " inerrant " broadly as spritually inerrant . Fundamentalists take the first four as literally true , and then validate them with a literally inerrant bible , which contains the first four , and which is the only thing known to contain the first four . Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was ! Its faith , Bill . You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else . Whatever works for you . Just don't foist it on others .

In this single posting of yours , I've seen more " constructs of imagination " than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group . First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about " the only true God , " whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes , but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself . I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths , believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ , but in a different way or fashion than your own . Not that it really matters , the mission and progress of the lds church will go on , boldly and nobly , and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing , until it has visited every continent , swept every clime , and sounded in every ear . # This is really a red herring . It doesn't address any issue raised , but # rather , it seeks to obfuscate . The fact that some groups try to read # something into the Bible , doesn't change what the Bible teaches . Sigh . " What the Bible teaches " ? Or : " what the bible teaches according to Robert Weiss and co . ? " I respect the former , I reject the latter without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus . On the contrary . And by the way , I do respect your interpretations of the Bible , I even grant you being a Christian ( following your own image of Him ) , as much as I am a Christian ( following my own image of Him in my heart ) . ( ... ) # Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of # Bruce McConkie and whether his views were ' official doctrine . ' I don't # think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon . That is not the # issue . Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this # subject is the real issue . The indication from Rick is that they may # certainly be . The issue is , of course , that you love to use anything to either mis - represent or ridicule the lds church . The issue of " official doctrine " is obviously very important . McConkie's views have been controversial ( e . g . " The Seven Deadly Heresies " has made me a heretic ! ;-) at best , or erroneous at worst ( " blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation " ) . I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church , but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations ( his book " Mormon Doctrine " is oftentimes referred to as " McConkie's Bible " in mormon circles ) on mormon doctrine . I rather look to official ( doctrinal ) sources , and ... to Hugh Nibley's books ! ( The last comment is an lds-insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have , but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine , some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation . But having said this , I find McConkie ( even in his most biased and speculative moments ) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen .

But just for grins , suppose we > almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called " reality " . > What then ? Then we all live happily ever after . :-) Seriously , if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in , I suspect we'd all agree on the best course of action . Unfortunately , I have no confidence that such a situation will ever arise . Some of us think there's a big God in the sky , some don't . Some think they've been chosen by God , others disagree . Some think they are infallible , others think otherwise . Until those disagreements over circumstances can be ironed out , there's little hope of everyone agreeing . > Or say , for all practical intents and purposes , there is no frame > of reference in which thus and such is good , isn't that approximately > objective , in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to > outrun a snail ? Yes . I think that , for example , only a vanishingly small number of people would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million Jews is good . So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value as I've encountered in my life so far . > For example , if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area , > isn't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act , even > though there conceivably might be some tail-end case that would justify it ?

Right . The key point , however , is that there are vanishingly few of these moral issues where we can get 99.9 % of people to agree on the outcome for all frames of reference ( and agree on the frames of reference ... ) > # > What you do not get > # > is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist > # > is inferior to that of the man of peace . > # > #Sorry , but that's not so .

It is also a point of respect : I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their own choices , and I expect the same to be returned . You , on the other hand , do not trust them , and want to make the choice for them--whether they like it or not . It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency : if you believe that you have the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives , then you must , by logic , admit that other people have the same right of interference in your life . ( Yes , I know ; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference .

I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead . The FBI and the BATF could not let a man like that live . He was a testimonial to their stupidity and lies . Now before everyone gets crazy with me , let me say that Koresh was crazy as a bed bug , but out government was crazier ... and they lied to us . They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time . Yet , whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into town on a regular basis . Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and wondered why they didn't pick him up then . There are two possible answers . First , they didn't see him . What kind of survaillance is that ? Second , they didn't care . They wanted a confrontation . They wanted publicity and they got it . After the first battle , they told us that they did not know he knew they were coming . They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that . Well , we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway . Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige ? According to them they did , but according to the Hartford Courant , the woman that raised Koresh ( His Grandmother ) was not allowed to go in and see him . The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he said : " A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out . His grandmother raised Vernon Howell ; ( Koresh's Real name ) she didn't raise David Koresh . " Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a logical level . There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you . Here's another one . All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must be done . Now they claim they never thought he would do it ? I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how much money this was costing . That was the start of the " Justification " part part of the plan . That's when I knew it would come soon . But , back to the plan . It is considered " Cruel and Unusal Punishment " to execute criminals in the minds of many people , but look at what's acceptable . They knew the parents ( adults ) had gas masks . They did not know , or were not sure , if the children had them . So the plan was to pour the gas into the compound . The mothers , seeing what the gas was doing to their children were supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with . I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR ( Chemical , Biological Radiological ) warfare training . Part of that training is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were subjected to . To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical agent that irritates the skin . You think its on fire . I have no doubts the children would become hysterical . Its not the kind of thing you never want to do again . This was the plan , the final solution . We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran . We gave these people 51 days . I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole thing that the government could point to as a success . Well , FBI agent Ricks changed my mind . Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant : " And while expressing regret at the loss of life , he suggested that the operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt . " It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success . One more thought . The government claimed that they believed he had automatic weapons on the premises . HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN ! THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE . THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY ! Still , without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him . For all of this my President takes full responsibility . What a guy ! I hope he gets it .

Study Harder , TonyFrom : weinss@rs6101.ecs.rpi.edu ( Stephen Andrew Weinstein ) Subject : New Religion Forming - - Sign Up Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use the net as its major recruitment medium . Therefore , even if this religion does not take off , its founding members will be very important historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become common . The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's accounts of the facts and historical events is correct . For example , Story of Adam and Eve : Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant . Have unlimited supply of food provided , but no clothing , jobs , or knowledge . God says not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge . They do anyway , then try to hide in bushes . God finds them and forces them out of Garden . ( There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in the bushes that might have angered God . ) Traditional Philosophy : 1 . The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat . If someone else will provide you with food , then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK . This is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades . 2 . Authority figures , such as God , whoever was behind the Vietnam War , Hitler and slaveowners , are always right and should be blindly followed without question by ordinary people , who can't make decisions for themselves . Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy : They were not supposed to eat the fruit . They should have done whatever God told them to . Like small children , they had their needs provided for and were obligated to do whatever their " Father " said to . Being forced to leave the Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment . Lessons from Traditional Interpretation : 1 . Ignorance is good . Knowledge is bad , but tempting . 2 . Having food provided for you for nothing ( read " welfare " ) is ideal . Get - ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment . 3 . Public nudity is good . Covering up is bad . 4 . Authority figures are intrinsically right . Normal people are dumb and should do whatever they are told without question . They should not think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from learning . For example , it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read . 1990 ' s philosophy : 1 . People should seek education and employment outside the home , unless named " Hillary Clinton " or " Murphy Brown " . 2 . People should use common sense . They should not kill other people ( binding of Issac , wars , Holocaust , etc . ) just because they are told to . Interpretation of events based on current philosophy : They were supposed to eat the fruit . God gave wanted them to seek knowledge rather than be handed it on a silver platter . Once they had gained knowledge and ( by seeking it ) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them - selves , they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were REWARDED by being allowed into the " real world . " Lessons from new interpretation : 1 . Ignorance is bad . Knowledge is good , but must be sought . 2 . Having food provided for you for nothing ( read " welfare " ) is at best a temporary measure . Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is ideal . 3 . Public nudity is bad . Covering up is good . 4 . Authority figures are often wrong . Normal people are intelligent and should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and " alter or abolish " bad governments . They should think for themselves . 5 . People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge but should seek it anyway , and all the harder . For example , poor children without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better life for their children ( and themselves ) . I have tentatively named this new philosophy " The Church of Eveism " because Eve's decision to eat the apple is man [ sic ] kind's first good decision , instead of its first bad one , as traditionally believed . She is therefore clearly a protagonist . God at first appears evil , for telling people not to seek knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist . As God rewarded the decision to defy him , and provided the tree in the first place , the intention and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained , but to delay it until it was actively sought . - - - End serious discussion .

In general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence , like drugs , which can be flushed down the toilet . They are not the standard way to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber . If there is no need to search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and order the suspect to come out with her hands up .

It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way . It is the most dangerous way to arrest anyone . The cops are charging into a room and they don't know what is in it . It is much safer to surround the place and announce yourself . > Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops , that's > not an excuse to murder police . In the case of the BD's , there was > almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who > would pretend to be cops . Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers . Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works . If they are arrested they call their lawyer , post bail and hope for a plea bargain . If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid . Drug dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other criminals , not to shoot cops . Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids because the criminals aren't aware that they are cops . No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to end in disaster . Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not committed any crime , they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong . If they have the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the housebreakers are criminals not cops . Cops and homeowners may die . The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal weapons were found . In this case the no-knock warrant was not called for . It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet . The ATF could have surrounded the compound . A marked police car could have driven up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and served the warrant usual way . It this had happened and and Koresh refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of the t . p . g folks would have kept quiet . - - Rod Anderson N0NZO | " I do not think the United States government Boulder , CO | is responsible for the fact that a bunch of rcanders@nyx.cs.du.edu | fanatics decided to kill themselves " satellite N0NZO on ao - 16 | Slick Willie the CompassionateFrom : royc@rbdc.wsnc.org ( Roy Crabtree ) Subject : Re : A Message for you Mr .

We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that a survivor made this claim . We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire . In the absense of any more evidence , I don't see how we can decide who to believe . Furthermore , its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else .

This is a good reason to believe that the BD's did . I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities . Its more likely that the BD's started the fire than did the FBI .

The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs . I am truely amazed that I have heard ( or read ) of no one suggesting this possibility . With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and the adults wearing gas masks , it had to have been chaotic inside . I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over . With the winds , it would have quickly gotten out of control . | > | > So we are left with two reasonable possibilities .

No , I think that D is also quite reasonable . I personally can't really asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if forced to bet on the issue , I would probably take an accident ( either FBI or BD ) over intential setting of the fire ) . I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered had gunshot wounds . The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically denied that they've reach any such conclusions . He pointed out that under intense heat , sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard . In short , there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many scenarios as to what happened on Monday .

We * are * footing the bill . Maybe they will take choice A . Maybe they will take choice B . Maybe they will take choice C . They can't afford any * one * of them . If they take choice A we'd have to pay them , say $ 5 . If they take choice B it would cost us $ 20 . If they take choice C it will cost us $ 20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next 18 years . Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay for ? Now some people happen not to like choice A . Other people happen not to like choice C ( paying for it , that is ) . C has been around and paid for for years . Even though it means we spend a lot of money , we can't in conscience refuse to pay for it . Now A has been around and is perfectly legal , but it hasn't been funded in the past . Now A is going to be funded but some people object . They don't like the idea of their tax money going to pay for choice A . So we could refuse to fund A at all . Then those women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice B or C , which will cost * all of us * more money . Most of us don't see any reason at all why * more money * should be spent to the effect of * removing personal choice * from some women . The alternative is to fund A if that is what the mother chooses . We will also still fund B and even C if * that * is what the mother chooses . However , some women will certainly choose A , and that will then save us $ 15 we otherwise would have had to spend . Your " taxes " are not being raised to fund a choice you object , they are being * lowered * because we will fund a choice that is * legal * , despite your objections to it . ( Actually , your taxes are not really going to go down , as I'm sure you would point out .

This is bullshit . We are * not * refusing " to make the alternative affordable too " . If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth , * then * your statement would make sense .

Rob , sometimes Brian K . comes across as honest . I know this . But Brian K . vasillates back and forth . One post looks honest ; the next is an excuse .

I wish Brian would read the Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being sidetracked with the temptation to mock God .

Here's is how I see the dialog : Me : " Brian K , please step aside before you get run over . " BK : " There is no truck . " Me : " Turn around at look . " BK : " No . " Me : " Look ! You will be healthier if you do take a look at the oncoming truck . " BK : " No . Explain to me why trucks exist . " Me : " Turn around or you will run over . " BK : " No . I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday . " Me : " You blind fool ! Why do you choose ignorance ? You have nothing to lose if you look . But if do not look , you will certainly lose your life . " I do not want to see you squashed all over the road . BK : " It is my life to lose . I rather not look . Besides , a truck running over me will not harm me . " And by the way , I really have an open mind . " So is my motivation to belittle Brian , or to love Brian the best I know how ? I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out . Because millions if not billions of people fall into the same category . Perhaps all people fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives . I have . I can now see the truck behind Brian . My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the truck coming towards him . My hope is that Brian will want to step out of the way . My fear , though , is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself to the middle of the highway , where he will certainly get run over . But if he so chooses , he so chooses , and there is nothing I can do beyond that to change his mind . For it is his choice . But at this very moment , Brian hasn't gotten even that far . He is still at the point where he does not want to look . Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me , but his head will not turn around to see the entire picture . So far he is satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance . Thank you again Rob for your reproach . I really do appreciate it .

I think the passage you're looking for is the following . Matthew 5:17 " Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets ; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them . Matthew 5:18 For truly , I say to you , till heaven and earth pass away , not an iota , not a dot , will pass from the law until all is accomplished . Matthew 5:19 Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven ; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven . Matthew 5:20 For I tell you , unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees , you will never enter the kingdom of heaven . There are several problems with this . The most serious is that the Law was regarded by Jews at the time ( and now ) as binding on Jews , but not on Gentiles . There are rules that were binding on all human beings ( the so-called Noachic laws ) , but they are quite minimal . The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus ' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ . The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished . It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles . This is a simple answer , which I think just about everyone can agree to . ( A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in Acts 15 . ) However there's more involved . In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law , we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law , and how that relates to Jesus ' commendation of the Law . At least as I read Paul , he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded . Again , this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law . In the middle of his discussion , Paul notes that he might be understood this way , and assures us that that's not what he intends to say . Rather , he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness . But ultimately it's an impossible standard , and one that has been superceded by Christ . Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here , and not everyone agrees with my reading . But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law . It still remains as an uncompromising standard , from which not an iota or dot may be removed . For its purpose of convicting of sin , it's important that it not be relaxed . However for Christians , it's not the end - - ultimately we live in faith , not Law . While the theoretical categories they use are rather different , in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion . The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount , where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law . The " not an iota or dot " would suggest a rather literal reading , but in fact that's not Jesus ' approach . Jesus ' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law , and stay away from the ceremonial details . Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws . Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17- 20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent . Jewish discussions . Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs , but neglecting the things that really matter : justice , mercy and faith , and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned , but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity . ( Mat 23:23- 25 ) This , and the discussion later in Mat 5 , suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind , and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength , he is thinking of these aspects of it . Paul's conclusion is similar . While he talks about the Law being superceded , all of the specific examples he gives involve the " ceremonial law " , such as circumcision and the Sabbath . He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards . The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded , and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained , I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law . Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision . As is natural in letters responding to specific situations , he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble : the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies . He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct . On the other hand , when Jesus commends the Law , he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships , and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble . It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways , but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts . Look at the way terms like " family values " take on special meaning from the current context . Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why " family values " should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U . S . I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in . Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term " Law " , any more than people who concerned about the " family values " movement are really opposed to family values .From : m23364@mwunix.mitre.org ( James Meritt ) Subject : Re : Silence is concurance In article <9157@blue.cis.pitt.edu> joslin@pogo.isp.pitt.edu ( David Joslin ) writes : } For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between } Jim and I , Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out Hate to shatter your self image of perfection that you appear to hold , but your language is wrong : Jim and me . } I pointed out that I did , in fact , agree that both Robert Weiss and } Jim Meritt took quotes out of context .

The rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast was for prime-time , and that Koresh never even heard it played . Wasn't even tuned in to the radio when it aired - - so no reason to come out . If later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire transcript - - I'm certain Koresh would think he was at the mercy of evil itself .

Dear Joakim , let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions , but that by asking , you will find as many different explanations as there are respondents . As a Latter-day Saint , I believe that all of us ( you , me , etc . ) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father ( Hebrews 12:9 ) in the pre-mortal existance . In order to continue our eternal progression , an earthly probationary time was required . ( To live by faith , not by sight , to choose good over evil , and to prepare ourselves in all things to become worthy of a higher order of existance . ) We believe that all of God's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of this earthly sojourn . One-third chose for Lucifer's plan , most followed the Firstborn ( the pre-mortal Jesus Christ ) . Lucifer's aspirations ( " I will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . . " Isaiah 14:12- 17 , etc . ) resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and those who followed Him , resulting in the casting out of Lucifer ( who became Satan , the father of lies ) and one-third of the hosts of heaven ( " And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth . . . " Revelation 12:4 ) as demons ( evil spirits ) . To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth , and to be subject to God and His plan ( for good or bad , based upon our obedience and choices ) , we made that choice individually . ( God speaking to Job : " Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth , . . . when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God shouted for joy ? " Job 38:4- 7 ) . We lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance ( the " Veil of Forgetful - ness , " somewhere in Psalms ) , in order to live by faith , not by sight . You may not accept this scenario , neither do quite a few who rely on the Bible alone , which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular aspect of our existence as individuals , as sons and daughters of God . #Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so #righteous as god likes us to believe ? Are all christians a flock of sheep , #unable to do otherwise that follow the rest ? # #Hmmmmmmmmmmmm . ( All Christians , by definition , ARE a flock of sheep , following the Shepherd as they understand Him ;-) - - But in any event , not all Christians believe in the same theology , such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in . ( They will cry " heresy " and other accusations of " perverting " the doctrines of the Bible , while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations , as found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals ... ) As for me , I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as explained above , is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine , some Dead Sea Scroll books , the pseudographion , other ( Jewish ) sources , and last but not least , modern-day revelation on the subject . # I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm , I mean it . # # How should one deal with a man who is convinced that # he is acting according to God's will , and who there - # Jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by # stabbing you in the back ? # # - Voltaire Casper C .

" ( follow-up ) I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post . In retrospect I would also like to quote another source : Douglas C . Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_ THERAPY INEFFECTIVE Recently the founders of yet another prominent " ex-gay " ministry , Exodus International , denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective . Michael Busse and Gary Cooper , cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years , were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979 . The program was described by these men as " ineffective . . . not one person was healed . " They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees ; many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed " reparative therapy . " The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE , June 30 , 1992 called " The Ex-Ex-Gay " by Robert Pela . Some personal thoughts : It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks . This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition , only all they required was a confession of faith ( after much torture ) and then , to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death . Even later , the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery , oppression and segragation of African-Americans , even to the justification of lynchings . Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach . The tool is still coersion , but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control , convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them , then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete . Sure , no one is " physically " forced to stay in this " reparative therapy " but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate . As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life . A person should be judged by the contibution , or non-contribution to the society in which they live , not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven ' ; t a clue what is in their heart .

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object is apparent . However , the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there even though it is not detectable . Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand ( ! ) but I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree . I think our two definitions can sit side by side without too much trouble , though . I haven't attempted to define the reason behind the Moral Driver ( only hinted through the essence of each Moral ) .

I have no particular plan ( except to do my bit - personal ethics AND social work ) . My opinion ( for what it is worth ) is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow , and that this will probably take several generations to be effective . I don't think that the list of Morals has changed for Society significantly , though . The Authority element may come from our authority figures and roles models ( see Eric Berne and his transactional analysis work [ + Mavis Klein ] for references ) and this is what gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term . I've had some more thoughts on my definitions : I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature ( ie . the interplay of the Moral Code and associated Authorities ) . A suitable analogy might be a graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of frequencies and the chosen ' amplitudes ' , and the Moral Character being the spectrum over time . Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often unwanted . I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given time which compromises one's Moral Nature . My Conscience fits in more with Freud's SuperEgo ( plus the Moral Driver ) with the stimulous being the urges or Freud's Id . The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego , I suppose . If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained . The question is " what provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver ? " .

You've got to understand my point-of-view : I see Christians spouting Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that will level all opposition . Truth is , it's not . Robert has never demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply ; he just rattles them off day by day . Some brazenly fly in the face of common sense and reality , and I point these out where I can . But even more than that , even when Christians * do * try to explain the verses in their own words , they do so from a Christian point of view , which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only he or she understood the Christian message properly , and then all strife and suffering on the earth would end . Here's the problem with that : substitute " Moslem " or " Buddhist " or " Satanist " instead of " Christian " , and it means the same thing . Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book . But if you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD , you've got some convincing to do . > I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of > knowledge .

Science has its basis in observable fact . I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on the values of the observer . Science is a human activity and as such , is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human activity . The myth that scientists are above moral influence or ethical concern , that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist , is nonsense . Bill : If one is to argue for objective values ( in a moral sense ) then one must : first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective . Considering : the meaning of the word " objective " I doubt that this will ever happen . : So , back to the original question : : And objective morality is ... ? This may be an unfortunate choice of words , almost self-contradictory . Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of people . The first term is all inclusive , the second is specific . The concept supposedly described may have meaning however . If there is a God as described by the Christians ( for instance ) , then He has existence apart from and independent of humankind ; His existence is outside of our frame of reference ( reality ) . If this being declares a thing to be so , it is - necessarily - so since He has defined Himself as omnipotent and , if His claims are to be believed , He is at least omnipotent relative to us . God is intrinsically self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an objective sense . If God determines a standard of conduct , that standard is objective . If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that standard while permitted to ignore it , they substitute a relative morality or mode of conduct , giving the term morality a nebulous , meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to misunderstand . The standard is objective and the conduct required to meet that standard is therefore objectively determined . Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is infinitely malleable , doesn't mean that the objective standard itself doesn't exist . Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural norm , or the preferred conduct of " decent " people , making it seem subjective , but it is derived from an absolute , objective , standard . Ironically , this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true nature ( according to Christianity at least ) , yet is condemned as being contrary to human nre , oppressive and severe . This may be due as Bill much to our amoral inclinations as to the standard itself , but like it or not , it's there . xFrom : sandvik@newton.apple.com ( Kent Sandvik ) Subject : Re : 14 Apr 93 God's Promise in 1 John 1 : 7 In article <1993Apr15.202729.6649@organpipe.uug.arizona.edu> , brian@lpl.arizona.edu ( Brian Ceccarelli 602/621- 9615 ) wrote : > Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7 .

Glad to hear this , just a note , Osiris , Mithras and many other cult gods resurrected as well , so there's a good chance for all of us to maybe end up in a virtual reality simulator , and live forever , hurrah ! Sorry , this was a joke , some sort of one anyway . I'm the first that connected Osiris with a virtual reality personality database . Time to write a book .

Well , looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various places at the same time , which would indicate that this was a planned action . I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't * deliberately * start a possible fire , having a sniper kill Korresh would have been a far easier method . Looking at the careful operation , and use of tear gas that as I know don't start fires , it is less likely that this was the case .
