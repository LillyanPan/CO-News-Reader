Clustering
	Based on
		1. Distance measure: quantifies similarity of objects
		2. Cluster alg: how to group objects
		Aim: small within cluster differences; large outer cluster differences

		Use correlation distance method - normalizes data; shows trend not abs value

	Pratition
		k-means
		Example k = 2
		1. Pick two random points
		2. Partition groups based on distance from all points to center
		3. Recalculate means/ceners
		4. Repeat
