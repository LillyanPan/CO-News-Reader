man: help
be careful about relative vs absolute pathnames

Absolute Pathnames
	sequence of directory names b/w root and specific file
Relative
	directory names below the directory where you are now to the directory of interest

Note:
 cd ../<dir name> - goes back up to parent
 cat : print file on screen; will concatinate files
 rmdir: can only remove empty directory
 chmod: changemode
 	ex. chmod 600 <filename> //write and execute

Pipes ('|')
	output of one program on left is piped into the program on the right
	ex. > head -100 <filename> | tail | grep foobar // 100 first lines of file will pump into tail and then will search for foobar
