Midterm
Problem 1
	Valid interaction pairs: Pick a pair of sequencing genes that go fwd and bwd/ bwd, fwd each from a differnt gene
	Use bwasw aligner to map read to gene
	Same gene mapped to different genes need to be count for both constructs

Problem 2 : homologs (easier?)
	Two lists of genes of their e-values of the two different geneomes
	See if e-value of gene from one group is highest in the other group
