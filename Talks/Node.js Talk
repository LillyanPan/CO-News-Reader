Node.js

Usage
	Web Dev - building servers
	Platform Indp Scripting - access to file operations; bash script and batch file
Why use?
	accessibility of server dev by front-end
	code reuse b/w client and server (same language in front and back end, same APIs)
	Write very efficient js engines; have things run quickly
You App
	V8 - js engine in chrome (C++), Memory management; executing raw js code
	libuv - event loop/IO for servers; read and write files (C)
		event loop- scheduling js that needs to run and IO operations that also needs to run;
					interleaving
	Glue - APIs/Internals that bring together V8 and libuv
		delegating out to js
	Core Libraries - JS
		JS Bindings
		~OR~
		Core Libraries (C++)
			Advantage: speed of writing in native code
