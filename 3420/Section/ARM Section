All registers 32 bits

Endian: how data is aligned

int a[4] = {0,1,2,3}
int b = a[1]
R0 = b; R3 = a[1]; R2 = 1

Data
	addr A 			0
					1
					2
					3

Codes
					LDR, R3, #addr A // address is 32 bits, but instructions can 					only be 16 bits; impossible
					LDR R3 [SP #...] // instead
					MOV R2 #4
					LDR R0 [R3,R2]
Stack Operations
	Push / pop some or all regs to stack
	Link register lr points to b
	push {r4-r7, lr}
	pop {r4-r7, pc}
