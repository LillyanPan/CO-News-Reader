Instructions:
    Download starting code from the masterbranch of the repo NurseStatusUpdateBaseStation

    Fill out the following methods:
        Database.write(key, value)
            a thread safe function (uses locks) that writes to the dict, 'self.database'. a write for a dict consists of 'dict[key] = value'
        Database.read(key)
            a thread safe function (uses locks) that reads from the dict, 'self.database', using a key 'key'
        Database.inDatabase(key)
            a thread safe function (uses locks) that checks if the key exists in the dict, self.database

    Note: as database is now a thread safe structure you no longer need to worry about threads for the following

        VitalDataHandler.formatText(patientId,location,status)
            returns a string that will be sent as the final text to nurses (format is up to you, we'll choose the collective best)
        VitalDataHandler.isNegStatusChange(patientId,location,status)
            checks if the input 'status' is a neg status change in comparison to the existing status in the db
            in patientDb: key -> patientId+','+location; value -> status
        VitalDataHandler.sendText(msg)
            checks for nurses in nurseDb and sends 'msg' to all nurses
            Note: the code provide will print 'msg' onto the terminal
        VitalDataHandler.saveInfo(patientId,location,status)
            saves the new patient data to patientDb
            in patientDb: key -> patientId+','+location; value -> status
        VitalDataHandler.run()
            the main method of the handler. It will use the input, 'self.dataInput' which is of the form: "patientId,location,status", and notify nurses if need be and update the database with the new info afterwards.
            Note: don't forget about the case in which the key doesn't exist
        NurseHandler.addPhoneNum(name,num)
            add to the nurseDb using 'name' as the key and 'num' as the value
        NurseHandler.run()
            this method will wait for input from the commandline to receive name and num of nurses

    Create test cases for each function using pythons 'unit test' framework
