- Testing
April

- Testing/integration
Other things
- Purchase GSM HC-05, 2 Microsticks
- Design/purchase PCB (printed circuit board)
- Document everything (especially because working with a customer)


Bluetooth: smartphone app/ integrate with bluetooth
GSM: Figure out libraries/ port to PIC

Threads/Procedures
	Formats; organization

Bluetooth:
	Is a fail safe
	Get bluetooth data and display (Android)
	Set up to store to GSM data
	4 weeks - 1 month
	send data?
someone in charge, who wants to monitor the water quality; go and get data- send from bluetooth, the updates the better; if GSM goes down then someone can use bluetooth to send data (fail safe)
